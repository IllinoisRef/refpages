    "text": "About  Inputting answers No Fractions: Do not use fractions as your input answer. Instead use decimal numbers (e.g. 2/3 is not accepted as a correct answer, however 0.667 is). Error tolerance is 1%: Your answer must be accurate to within a relative tolerance of 0.01. For example, you may (correctly) compute a strain value of x = 1.17*10^(-3) using symbolic expressions. If you enter your answer as x = 0.0012 (exactly five digits, and two significant digits), PrairieLearn will mark the answer 0.0012 incorrect, as the difference between these two values is about 2.5% (that is, (1.2-1.17)/1.17 = 0.0256) and exceeds PL's tolerance for correct answers. Parenthesis: You should be obsessive about making sure your equations are typed correctly. Example: Powers - the entire base is wrapped in parenthesis as well as the power (i.e. 3*2^1/3 vs. (3*2)^(1/3)). Example: Division - the numerator and denominator are both individually wrapped in parenthesis (i.e. 1/2*3 vs. 1/(2*3)). Your code should look like you don't trust the built-in order of operations. Be obsessive. Units: It is your responsibility to check the units in your problem. You should know the base units (i.e. \\( \\rm\\ MPa = \\frac{\\rm N}{\\rm mm^2} \\) , \\( \\rm\\ ksi = \\frac{\\rm kips}{\\rm in^2} \\) , etc.) and how to convert given units (i.e. \\( \\rm\\ MPa = 10^6 \\ Pa, 12 \\ \\text{in} = 1 \\ \\text{ft} \\) , etc.). This is another thing that you should be very careful about. When doing a problem, it is good to write out the units as a separate equation to make sure that it makes sense. For example: $$ \\begin{align} \\delta &= \\frac{FL}{EA} \\\\ [\\rm mm] &= \\frac{[\\rm kN][\\rm mm]}{[\\rm MPa][\\rm mm^2]} \\\\ [\\rm mm] &= \\frac{[\\rm kN][\\rm mm]}{[\\frac{\\rm N}{\\rm mm^2}][\\rm mm^2]} = \\frac{[10^3 \\rm N][\\rm mm^3]}{[\\rm N][\\rm mm^2]} \\\\ \\therefore [\\rm mm] &= [\\rm mm] \\end{align} $$ Note: The \\(10^3\\) conversion would need to be applied to the force for the final equation to be true. If everything is given in \\(\\rm\\ N\\) and \\(\\rm\\ m\\), but the answers ask for \\(\\rm\\ kN\\) and \\(\\rm\\ mm\\), then it is your responsibility to convert the answer. Be obsessive about checking these things before submitting your answer. Reviewing for CBTF Quizzes Review for quizzes with the relevant homework assignment. The course website tells you which homeworks are relevant and explicitly states the topics covered in each quiz. The quiz problems are similar to those found on the homework. Doing the homework, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to make sure that you fully understand as completely as possible the solution you reach for each question. When reviewing your homework problems, you should make sure that you can do the problem on paper, type it into your calculator of choice, and get the correct answer on the first try. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to overlook some key concepts in the course by \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrute forcing\u00e2\u0080\u009d signs and units in the homework (see above). If you find you are consistently getting answers off by factors of 10, or making a sign error, it can be easy to correct and overlook while doing the homework, but be very costly during the quiz. If you are arriving at the correct answer on your first try for each of the homework questions, then the next step would be to consider potential modifications to the questions. How would the procedure for solving the problem change if you were given different information? What information was absolutely necessary to solve the problem? Do you understand why you were able to make all of the assumptions you did? Using a Python script is strongly recommended as is can help you keep track of your work.

    "text": "Cartesian coordinates  Cartesian coordinates (also known as rectangular coordinates) are the regular \\(x,y\\) or \\(x,y,z\\) coordinates in 2D and 3D, with perpendicular straight-line axes. coordinate name range definition \\(x\\) horizontal \\(-\\infty \\lt x \\lt \\infty\\) horizontal distance from the \\(y\\)-axis \\(y\\) vertical \\(-\\infty \\lt y \\lt \\infty\\) vertical distance from the \\(x\\)-axis In 3D the \\(x\\),\\(y\\),\\(z\\) axes are oriented in right-handed order, so that fingers curling from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) means the thumb points in the \\(z\\) direction. Cartesian coordinate system, showing the origin \\(O\\) and three positions with their coordinates. Notation note When writing coordinates we can either list the coordinate values explicitly, like \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 1\\), or we can just write the numbers in an ordered list, like \\( (2, 1) \\). Writing them as a list assumes that we know which coordinate system we are using, and which order the coordinates are in. We will typically write the coordinate values explicitly to avoid confusion. This also applies to vector components. Vector bases To describe vectors mathematically, we write them as a combination of basis vectors. An orthonormal basis is a set of two (in 2D) or three (in 3D) basis vectors which are orthogonal (have 90\u00c2\u00b0 angles between them) and normal (have length equal to one). We will not be using non-orthogonal or non-normal bases. Any other vector can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors: Components of a vector. #rvv-ec $$ \\vec{a} = a_1 \\,\\hat{\\imath}+ a_2 \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + a_3 \\,\\hat{k} $$ The numbers \\(a_1, a_2, a_3\\) are called the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) in the \\( \\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\hat{\\jmath}, \\hat{k} \\) basis. If we are in 2D then we will only have two components for a vector. Writing a vector as the sum of scaled basis vectors. The scale factors are the components of the vector. Here \\( \\vec{a} = 3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath \\), so the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) are \\(a_1 = 3\\) and \\(a_2 = 2\\). We draw the symbol \\(\\odot\\) (arrow tip) to indicate a vector coming out of the page, and \\(\\otimes\\) (arrow fletching) to indicate an arrow going into the page. Two standard arrangements of the basis vectors when working in 2D. Either \\(\\hat\\jmath\\) is the vertical and \\( \\hat{k} \\) is out of the page, or \\( \\hat{k} \\) is the vertical and \\(\\hat\\jmath\\) is into the page. In both cases \\(\\hat\\imath\\) is horizontal. Notation note Just as for position coordinates, we can write the vector components \\(3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath\\) as the ordered list \\((3, 2)\\) if we know which basis we are using. Because we often will be using several bases simultaneously, we will generally write the components explicitly in the \\(3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath\\) form. Right hand rule The Cartesian system is a \"right-handed\" coordinate system, which means that we can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the \\( x, y \\) and \\( z \\) axes. In 3D the \\( x, y, z \\) axes are oriented in right-handed order, so that fingers curling from \\( x \\) to \\( y \\) means the thumb points in the \\( z \\) direction. We can also use the individual fingers on our right hand, where our pointer finger points in the x-direction, our middle finger points in the y-direction, and our thumb points in the z-direction.",

Centroid The centroid denotes the geometric center of an object. When an object is made of a homogeneous material, the centroid and the center of mass are at the same point. If the object has an axis of symmetry, the centroid is on the axis of symmetry. In some cases, the centroid may not be on the object. To solve for the centroid of an object: Define your coordinate system Define the infinitesimally small element (usually \\(dL\\), \\(dA\\), or \\(dV\\)) Express the element in terms of the coordinate system you defined Identify any symmetry Define the centroid \\( (\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}) \\)of the element Plug the equations from 3 and 5 into the equations for the centroid The equation for the centroid of an object is: Centroid of an Object (3D) #com3D $$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\int{\\tilde{x}dV}}{\\int{dV}} $$ Centroid of an Object (2D) #com2D $$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\int{\\tilde{x}dA}}{\\int{dA}} $$ Centroid of an Object (1D) #com1D $$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\int{\\tilde{x}dL}}{\\int{dL}} $$ with similar equations for \\( \\bar{y} \\). + Example Problem: Centroid of a curved area #com-epc Solve for \\( \\bar{x} \\) Solve for \\( \\bar{y} \\)  Solve for \\( \\bar{x} \\) $$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\int \\tilde{x} \\,dA}{\\int dA} = \\frac{\\int x \\ y \\,dx}{\\int y \\,dx} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{1} x^3 \\,dx}{\\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \\,dx} = \\frac{\\frac{x^4}{4} \\Big|_{0}^{1}}{\\frac{x^3}{3} \\Big|_{0}^{1}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\ m $$ Solve for \\( \\bar{y} \\) $$ \\bar{y} = \\frac{\\int \\tilde{y} \\,dA}{\\int dA} = \\frac{\\int \\frac{y}{2} y \\,dx}{\\int y \\,dx} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x^4}{2} \\,dx}{\\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \\,dx} = \\frac{\\frac{x^5}{10} \\Big|_{0}^{1}}{\\frac{x^3}{3} \\Big|_{0}^{1}} = \\frac{3}{10} \\ m $$ Axes of symmetry If the shape has an axis of symmetry, the centroid falls on that line of symmetry. Shapes can also have more than one axis. For example, a rectangle has 2 axes, and a circle has infinite number of axes. This applies to composite shapes as well.

To solve for the centroid of our original shape \\( (\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}) \\), we take a weighted sum of each of the centroids of our smaller shapes. We will call the centroid locations of the smaller shapes \\( \\tilde{x} \\) and \\( \\tilde{y} \\). Composite Centroid (x) #compositex $$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum \\tilde{x}_i A_i}{\\sum A_i} $$ Composite Centroid (y) #compositey $$ \\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum \\tilde{y}_i A_i}{\\sum A_i} $$ For these equations, the weighted sum is dependent on the area of each individual shape. This is typically for 2D problems. You can also use length, weight, or mass as your weighing factor depending on what you're being asked to solve for. + Example Problem: Find centroid of a composite shape #com-ccs Solve for centroid \\( (\\bar{x} , \\bar{y}) \\) of the shape below.  First, we notice that there's a line of symmetry along \\( x = 2 \\ cm \\) , so we know that \\( \\bar{x} = 2 \\ cm \\). This means that we only need to solve for \\( \\bar{y} \\). $$ \\begin{aligned} (\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}) &= (2, ?) \\\\ \\bar{y} &= \\frac{\\sum \\tilde{y}_i A_i}{\\sum A_i} \\end{aligned} $$ We can do this by splitting our shape into composite shapes with known centroid locations.

    "text": "Force systems  Equivalent systems It can be helpful at times to reduce the forces on a body and combine resultant moments and simplify the analysis. Note: These forces and moments will have the same external effect on the body, but the internal forces on the rigid body may be different. For example, the four systems below are statically equivalent, which means that the sum of external forces and sum of external moments are the same for both systems. All four of these systems are statically equivalent. It can be helpful to know what are equivalent transformations for both forces and moments. These are described below: Allowable force transformations Replacing two forces with their vector sum: Moving a force ALONG its line of action: Allowable moment transformations Replacing a force couple with a couple moment: Moving a couple moment to another spot on a rigid body: Concentrated forces Concentrated forces are forces acting at a specific point on a body. A concentrated force applied to a bar at point A. Distributed loads Distributed loads (usually written as \\( w(x) \\)) are forces applied over a length, volume, or area. The SI units for distributed loads are N/m. These loads, written as a function of length \\( x \\) can be simplified into an equivalent force, \\( F_R \\), which results in the same external loading on the rigid body. The magnitude of the equivalent force \\( F_R \\) is the area under the \\( w(x) \\) curve. The location of the resultant force \\( F_R \\) is the location of the centroid of the shape of the force curve. Rectangular loading For a constant distributed load of magnitude c applied to a bar over a length l, the resultant force magnitude is Rectangular Distributed Load $$ F_R = c*l\\ $$ the resultant force location is at \\( l/2 \\). Example distributed load (top) and its equivalent force system (bottom). Triangular loading For a triangular distributed load (a uniformly varying load), the magnitude of the load is equivalent to the area of the triangle. Triangular Distributed Load $$ F_R = 0.5*c*l\\ $$ The location of \\( F_R \\) is 1/3 from the base of the triangle. Example triangular distributed load (top) and its equivalent force system (bottom). Nonuniform distributed loads More complex distributed loads can be reduced to two distributed loads of uniform shape, or the integral of the distributed load function can be taken to obtain the area under \\( w(x) \\), which is \\( F_R \\). Nonuniform Distributed Load $$ F_R = \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) \\,dx \\ $$ The location of \\( F_R \\) on the beam can be found by solving for the moment \\( M_R \\) about a point. In this case we will take the moment about the point \\( x \\)=0 and setting it equivalent to the moment produced by the resultant force \\( F_R \\) at \\( x \\)=0.

    "text": "Frames and machines  Frames and machines are systems that contain at least one non two force member. This means that at least one member in a frame or machine has at least 3 loads applied to it. Unlike trusses, frames and machines are not necessarily only loaded at the joints, and are not necessarily compsed of long, slender members. Multi-force members in both frames and machines have the potential to have not only axial internal loads, but also shear internal forces and internal bending moments. Frames are systems with at least one multi-force member that are generally designed to be stationary. Some examples of frames could be a children's playground or even a table. Machines Machines are systems with at least one multi-force member that have the potential to move. For example, an excavator is a machine. Frame and machine analysis Because frames and machines carry not only axial loads but also shear loads and bending moments, we can't use the method of joints or the method of sections to get internal forces. Instead, we need to \"break apart\" the pieces of the frame or machine and draw free body diagrams of each piece individually. Frame and machine analysis involves the following steps: Identify any two-force members and apply the two force member assumptions (see the Truss reference pages for more details) Identify any multi force members and make free body diagrams for each multip force member. Remember that the same forces in two different free body diagrams will be equal and opposite! Use equations of equilibrium to solve for the unknown forces in the free body diagrams. + Example Problem: Machine Example #machine-example This example is from Engineering Statics by Daniel Baker and William Haynes. In this question, we want to know what the cutting force is at A and B given an applied load \\( F \\)=60N.  Through examination, we first notice that the DE and AB are two force members, so the forces on those two members are equal and opposite and pass through the points AB and DE. The multi force members that we will examine are members GE and ACD. Let's start with member GE: Unknowns: \\( G_x, G_y, F_{DE} \\) $$ \\begin{align} &\\sum F_x = G_x + F_{DE} * \\cos \\theta = 0 \\\\ &\\sum F_y = G_y + F_{DE} * \\sin \\theta + F = 0 \\\\ &\\sum M_G = F * (145 \\text{ mm}) + (F_{DE} * \\sin \\theta) * (33 \\text{ mm}) = 0 \\end{align} $$ $$ \\text{where } \\theta = \\arctan \\frac{17}{16} = 46.7357 ^ \\circ $$ $$ F_{DE} = -F * \\frac{(145 \\text{ mm})}{(33 \\text{ mm}) * \\sin \\theta} = -362.038 \\text{ N} $$ Taking the sum of force in the x and y direction and the sum of moments about G, we can solve for \\( F_{DE} \\), which is -362.038 N. We can then draw a FBD for member ACD: Note that the force \\( F_{DE} \\), which was in the FBD for member GE, is facing the opposite direction in this FBD. Unknowns: \\( F_A, C_x, C_y \\) $$ \\sum M_C = 0 $$ $$ = -(F_{DE} * \\sin \\theta) * (49 \\text{ mm}) - (F_{DE} * \\cos \\theta) * (14 \\text{ mm}) -F_A * (61 \\text{ mm}) $$ $$ F_A = 268.692 \\text{ N} $$ Writing the sum of moments about point C allows us to solve for the force at A, which is 268.692 N. We can also calculate the mechanical advantage of this machine by dividing the cutting force by the applied force of 60 N. In this case, the maching gives a mechanical advantage of 4.478.",

Every free-body diagram should have the following: The body represented as a dot if it is a point mass, and the body itself if it is a rigid body. The external forces/moments.

A properly defined coordinate system A free-body diagram should not include the following: Bodies other than the body we are interested in.

    "title": "Friction",
    "text": "Friction  Friction is a force that resists the movement of two contacting surfaces sliding relative to each other. Frictional forces act tangential to the surface at the point of contact and act in opposition to the possible or existing motion between the surfaces. In TAM 210/211, we will focus on dry friction. Dry friction occurs between two surfaces with no lubricating fluid between them. Consider a box with applied load \\( P \\) and weight \\( W \\) sitting on a rough surface. The box has normal force \\( N \\) and frictional force \\( F_f \\) opposing the motion of the box: With a very small applied load, the box won't move. However, at some point, with a large enough \\( P \\), the box will start to slide along the surface. Writing the equations of equilibrium of the box and solving for \\( P \\) results in \\( P = F_f \\). As the applied load increases, the frictional force will also increase. This is indicated by the straight line on the \\( F_f \\) vs. \\( P \\) graph. Once the frictional force reaches a maximum, the box will begin to slide on the surface. The maximum static frictional force is written as: Limit on static friction force magnitude. $$ F_f \\le \\mu_s N $$ Variables \\( F_f \\) and \\( N \\) are the magnitude of the friction force \\( \\vec{F_f} \\) and the normal force \\( \\vec{N} \\), and \\( \\mu_s \\) is the coefficient of static friction.

It acts as a smooth surface that allows your bones to slide past each other when your body is moving. Articular cartilage is very slippery and has a very small coefficient of friction: as low as 0.001! This is similar to the coefficient of friction between two pieces of ice! Tipping vs. slipping Consider a box of length l that is sitting on a rough surface with an applied load P on the right side. As P increases, there are two possible scenarios: either the box will \"slip\" and start sliding along the surface, or the box will tip onto the right corner. tipping vs. slipping If the box experiences slipping, the normal force will act at a location x from the center of the box. The frictional force can be written as $$ F_f = \\mu_s N $$ You can use the other equations of equilibrium to solve for the force P required for the box to slip. If the box experiences tipping, the normal force will act at the bottom right corner of the box, and the couple from the frictional force and N will create a moment causing the box to tip. To determine which of these scenarios will occur, you should write the equations of equilibrium for each case and solve for the force P required to cause either slipping or tipping. Whichever condition has the smallest force P will be the condition that occurs. Note: See the derivation below for an explanation of why the normal force does not act at the center of mass of the box. Location of Normal Force: Derivation #nfl $$ \\begin{align} &\\sum F_x = P - F_f = 0 \\\\ &\\sum F_y = N - W = 0 \\\\ &\\sum M_O = -Py \\neq 0 \\end{align} $$  If the normal force N acted at the middle of the box (at the center of mass), we would write the three equations of equilibrium as follows: $$ \\sum F_x = P - F_f = 0 $$ $$ \\sum F_y = N - W = 0 $$ So far, so good! However, we run into a problem when we write the sum of moments equation: $$ \\sum M_O = -Py \\neq 0 $$ The sum of moments equation about point O results in an expression that is not possible: we know that P cannot be zero, so there must be some sort of moment about the center of the box from the normal force acting offset from the center of mass of the box. + Example Problem: Frictional forces on a fridge: Slipping and Tipping #undefined Given: Fridge weight = 250 lb and \\( \\mu_s \\) = 0.4 Find: The maximum horizontal force P that can be applied without causing movement of the fridge  Drawing a FBD of the fridge yields: We will then use the FBD and equations of equilibrium to solve for the force \\( P \\) necessary to make the fridge tip, and make the fridge slip along the surface: Assume slipping, max \\( F = \\mu_s \\ N \\) $$ \\begin{aligned} \\sum{F_x} &= 0 \\\\ P - F &= 0 \\\\ P &= F \\\\ \\sum{F_y} &= 0 \\\\ N - W &= 0 \\\\ N &= W \\end{aligned} $$ If \\( P = F \\leq \\mu_s \\ N \\) , the fridge won't slide Max \\( P \\) before sliding: $$ P = F = \\mu_s \\ N = \\mu_s \\ W = 0.4 \\ (250 \\ lb) = 100 \\ lb $$ Check to see if it is tipping at \\( P = 100 \\ lb \\), solve for \\( x \\) $$ \\begin{aligned} \\sum{M_o} &= Py - Nx = 0 \\\\ x &= \\frac{Py}{N} = \\frac{Py}{W} = \\frac{100 \\ lb \\ (40 \\ in)}{250 \\ lb} = 16'' \\end{aligned} $$ If \\( x = 18 '' \\) , the fridge would tip.

Hydrostatic Fluid Pressure: Hydrostatic fluid pressure refers to the pressure from a fluid that is at rest (the \"static\" part of hydrostatic). It orginates from the force of gravity acting on the fluid. Fluid pressure For an incompressible fluid (density \\( \\rho \\)) at rest, the pressure \\( P \\) varies linearly with fluid depth \\( z \\). This means that the pressure along a horizontal plane (at a certain depth \\( z \\)) is constant.

Pressure, distributed loads, and free body diagrams Hydrostatic fluid pessure is a type of distributed load. If you need a refresher on distributed loads, see the Distributed Loads Reference Page.

To solve for the resultant force from the distributed load we multiply by the area of the plate.

In these cases, it is easier to redraw our system and create articifial horizontal and vertical \"surfaces\", adding the force from the FBD of the weight of the water trapped in our horizontal and vertical surfaces. This method will result in the same resultant force on the slanted surface, but the distributed loads are easier to calculate. Using this method, we can solve for the resultant force by calculating the total horizontal forces (\\( F_H \\)) and vertical forces (\\( F_V \\)) and relating them using Resultant force from fluid pressure #res-force $$ F_R = \\sqrt{{F_H}^2+{F_V}^2} $$ + Example Problem: Resultant force on a curved plate #fluid-curved Find the magnitude of the resultant force from the fluid on the curved surface AB (thickness \\( t \\) of the surface \\( = 2 \\ m \\)).

There is no derivation for Newton's equations, because they are an assumed model for dynamics. We can only verify them by comparing with experimental evidence, which confirms that Newtonian dynamics are accurate for non-relativistic and non-quantum systems. Newton's first law A particle at rest stays that way unless acted on by unbalanced forces. Newton's second law Newton's second law: $$ \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} $$ Newton's third law The mutual forces of action and reaction between two particles are equal, opposite, and collinear. Example animate reset A point mass moving in the plane with an applied force. You can try to made the mass move in a circle and then see what happens when the force is suddenly removed, which will demonstrate Newton's first law (no net force implies motion at constant speed in a constant direction). Also observe which force directions cause the speed to increase or decrease. Click and drag to impart a force on the particle. Idealizations Particles In this course, we assume two things about particles: The mass of the particle is not 0. The radius of the mass is 0. Through these assumptions, we are essentially concentrating all of the mass of an object at a single point in space. The particle has a mass but the size and shape of the particle is not taken into account. Rigid bodies For rigid bodies, we assume that the object has both mass (similar to particles) but also take its shape into account. We call these bodies \"rigid\" because we assume that they do not deform under applied forces or moments. A rigid body is an extended area of material that includes all the points inside it, and which moves so that the distances and angles between all its points remain constant. The location of a rigid body can be described by the position of one point \\(P\\) inside it, together with the rotation angle of the body (one angle in 2D, three angles in 3D). location description point mass position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) rigid body in 2D position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) angle \\( \\theta \\) rigid body in 3D position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) angles \\( \\theta,\\phi,\\psi \\) Neither point masses nor rigid bodies can physically exist, as no body can really be a single point with no extent, and no extended body can be exactly rigid.

We can solve for these reaction forces to understand the loading of a structure. Types of connections Different supports and different connections have different types of reaction forces depending on what they are constraining. For example, a pin connection restricts movement in the x-and y-directions but doesn't restrict rotation. This means that each pin connection has two reaction forces: one in the x-direciton, and one in the y-direction corresponding to the degrees of freedom that are fixed. A roller support only constrains movement in the y-direction, and thus only has one reaction force (oriented in the y-direction). Constraints that produce one unknown reaction force. Constraints that produce multiple unknown reaction forces or moments. System classifications Redundant constraints If a body has more supports than it needs to hold it in equilibrium, it is overly constrained. This will result in more unknown reaction forces than equations we can write, and the problem will not be solvable using statics alone. This type of system is a \"statically indeterminate\" system. In a 2D system, we can write three equilibrium equations (forces in the x and y directions and moments about a point), which means we can solve system with up to three unknowns. If a 2D system has 3 or less unknown reaction forces, it is considered determinate. If it has more than three unknown reaction forces, it is considered indeterminate.

A system is considered properly constrained when there is a unique solution to the problem of determining support reactions. If there are multiple solutions to the problem, then the system is considered properly constrained with redundancy. If there is no solution, the system is considered to be improperly constrained for those specific loading conditions. Stability and instability If a system is stable in statics, it means that it cannot rotate or translate in any direction under any loading conditions. There are three ways we can analyze a 2D system to determine if it is stable or unstable: If there are less than three reaction forces, the system is unstable and considered \"underconstrained\". If all of the reaction forces have lines of action that are parallel to each other, the system is unstable for translation. Nothing is preventing the system from moving perpendicular to those lines.

Equilibrium of the two-force member implies 2FM Equilibrium $$ \\vec{F_A} + \\vec{F_B} = \\vec 0, $$ resulting in \\(|F_A| = |F_B|\\) \\( \\vec{F_A} \\) and \\( \\vec{F_B} \\) act along the same line of action. Examples of different two force members. Specifically, the two forces act along the line between the two points where they are applied. Zero force member Zero force members are members in a truss structure that experience no force. They act as support trusses to add stability, but are not load bearing. There are 2 cases where zero force members occur: Two noncolinear members share a pin with no support or external forces (Zero force member example, left - look at pin C!) Two colinear forces with a third noncolinear force on a pin (zero force member example, right - look at pins B and D!) Examples of different zero force members, highlighted in red. Note that when you remove those members there are more zero force members in each system that can also be eliminated! These rules will help us simplify trusses and solve for the internal forces in the desired members. Drawing free-body diagrams on trusses is simple. As mentioned in the beginning, we will choose the entire truss as our system and draw the free-body diagram to determine the reaction forces on pinned/roller joints. Note we will need more equations and free-body diagrams on individual truss members to fully determine the reaction forces. The following is a diagram showcasing eliminating zero-force members. Stage: 0 Truss analysis: method of joints Method of joints for truss analysis: Draw a free-body diagram for the entire truss and solve for the external reaction forces and moments at the supports Draw a free-body diagram of a joint with at least 1 known force and at most two unknown forces Use the equations of equilibrium for the joint to solve for the unknown forces Repeat steps 2 and 3 to find the forces in the trusses you are interested in. Note: Remember that truss members that are in compression \"push back\" on the pin joints, and truss members that are in tension \"pull\" on the pin joints. Truss analysis: method of sections The method of sections is helpful for determining the internal forces inside a truss member. The first step for the method of sections is the same as the firts step for the method of joints: Draw a FBD for the entire truss and solve for the external forces at the supports. Then, you \"cut\" the truss so that the internal force you want is \"exposed\" from the cut and analyze the two parts of the truss system to solve for the internal forces of the truss members.

    "text": "Vectors and scalars  Scalars vs. vectors Vectors A vector is an arrow with a length and a direction. Just like positions, vectors exist before we measure or describe them. Unlike positions, vectors can mean many different things, such as position vectors, velocities, etc. Vectors are not anchored to particular positions in space, so we can slide a vector around and locate it at any position. animate reset Change: length direction Two vectors, which may or may not be the same vector. Moving a vector around does not change it: it is still the same vector. Notation Some textbooks differentiate between free vectors, which are free to slide around, and bound vectors, which are anchored in space. We will only use free vectors. We will use the over-arrow notation \\( \\vec{a} \\) for vector quantities. Other common notations include bold \\( \\boldsymbol{a} \\) and under-bars \\( \\underline{a} \\). For unit (length one) vectors we will use an over-hat \\( \\hat{a} \\). Scalars While a vector represents magnitude and direction, a scalar is a number that represents a magnitude, but with no directional information. Some examples of scalar quantities can be mass, length, time, speed, or temperature. Vector operations Scaling vectors Vectors can be multiplied by a scalar number, which multiplies their length. Vector addition and subtraction Vectors can be added or subtracted together, using the parallelogram law of addition or the head-to-tail rule. Unit vectors A unit vector is any vector with a length of one. We use the special over-hat notation \\( \\hat{a} \\) to indicate when a vector is a unit vector. Any non-zero vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) gives a unit vector \\( \\hat{a} \\) that specifies the direction of \\( \\vec{a} \\). Normalization to unit vector. #rvv-eu $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{a} =\\frac{\\vec{a}}{a}\\end{aligned} $$  If we compute the length of \\( \\hat{a} \\) then we find: $$ \\| \\hat{a} \\| = \\left\\| \\frac{\\vec{a}}{a} \\right\\| = \\frac{\\|\\vec{a}\\|}{a} = \\frac{a}{a} = 1, $$ so \\( \\hat{a} \\) is really a unit vector, and it is in the same direction as \\( \\vec{a} \\) as they differ only by a scalar factor. Any vector can be written as the product of its length and direction: Vector decomposition into length and direction. #rvv-ei $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} = a\\hat{a}\\end{aligned} $$  This follows from rearranging #rvv-eu. Three vectors and their decompositions into lengths and directional unit vectors. Vector magnitude and direction Vectors can be written as a magnitude (length) multiplied by the unit vector in the same direction as the original vector. $$ \\vec{A} = \\|\\vec{A}\\| \\hat{u_A}\\ $$ The length of a vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) is written either \\( \\| \\vec{a} \\| \\) or just plain \\(a\\). The length can be computed using Pythagorus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 theorem: Pythagorus' length formula. #rvv-ey $$ a = \\|\\vec{a}\\| = \\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2} $$  First we prove Pythagorus' theorem for right-angle triangles. For side lengths \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\), the fact that \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) can be seen graphically below, where the gray area is the same before and after the triangles are rotated in the animation: animate reset Pythagorus' theorem immediately gives us vector lengths in 2D. To find the length of a vector in 3D we can use Pythagorus' theorem twice, as shown below. This gives the two right-triangle calculations: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\ell^2 &= a_1^2 + a_2^2 \\\\ a^2 &= \\ell^2 + a_3^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2. \\end{aligned} $$ Click and drag to rotate. + Warning: Length must be computed in a single basis. #rvv-wl The Pythagorean length formula can only be used if all the components are written in a single orthonormal basis. Computing the length of a vector using Pythagorus' theorem. Some common integer vector lengths are \\( \\vec{a} = 4\\hat\\imath + 3\\hat\\jmath \\) (length \\(a = 5\\)) and \\( \\vec{b} = 12\\hat\\imath + 5\\hat\\jmath \\) (length \\(b = 13\\)). + Warning: Adding vectors does not add lengths. #rvv-wa If \\( \\vec{c} = \\vec{a} + \\vec{b} \\), then \\( \\|\\vec{c}\\| \\ne \\|\\vec{a}\\| + \\|\\vec{b}\\| \\) unless \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) are parallel and in the same direction. It will always be true, however, that \\( \\|\\vec{c}\\| \\le \\|\\vec{a}\\| + \\|\\vec{b}\\| \\). This fact is known as the triangle inequality, for reasons that should be obvious. The direction of a vector can be written as a unit vector by dividing the vector components by the vector magnitude. The unit vector can be written as #uv $$ \\hat{u}_A = \\frac{A_x}{|A|} * \\hat{\\imath} + \\frac{A_y}{|A|} * \\hat{\\jmath} + \\frac{A_z}{|A|} * \\hat{k} $$  $$ \\begin{align} \\hat{u}_A &= \\frac{A_x}{|A|} * \\hat{\\imath} + \\frac{A_y}{|A|} * \\hat{\\jmath} + \\frac{A_z}{|A|} * \\hat{k} \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{|A|} * [A_x * \\hat{\\imath} + A_y * \\hat{\\jmath} + A_z * \\hat{k}] \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{|A|} * \\vec{A} \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{\\cancel{|A|}} * \\cancel{|A|} * \\hat{u}_A \\\\ &= \\hat{u}_A \\end{align} $$ Directional cosines Alternatively, the vector components can be determined geometrically via the angles of each component with respect to the Cartesian Axes. The vector can be written as #sc $$ \\begin{align} \\vec{A} &= A_x * \\hat{\\imath} + A_y * \\hat{\\jmath} * A_z * \\hat{k} \\\\ &= (|A| * \\cos \\alpha) * \\hat{\\imath} + (|A| * \\cos \\beta) * \\hat{\\jmath} + (|A| * \\cos \\gamma) * \\hat{k} \\end{align} $$  $$ \\begin{align} \\vec{A} &= A_x * \\hat{\\imath} + A_y * \\hat{\\jmath} * A_z * \\hat{k} \\\\ &= (|A| * \\cos \\alpha) * \\hat{\\imath} + (|A| * \\cos \\beta) * \\hat{\\jmath} + (|A| * \\cos \\gamma) * \\hat{k} \\\\ &= |A| * [\\cos \\alpha * \\hat{\\imath} + \\cos \\beta * \\hat{\\jmath} + \\cos \\gamma * \\hat{k}] \\\\ &= |A| * \\hat{u}_A \\end{align} $$ Scalar and vector products Dot product The dot product (also called the inner product or scalar product) is defined by Dot product from components. #rvv-es $$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}= a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 $$ An alternative expression for the dot product can be given in terms of the lengths of the vectors and the angle between them: Dot product from length/angle. #rvv-ed $$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}= a b \\cos\\theta $$  We will present a simple 2D proof here. A more complete proof in 3D uses the law of cosines. Start with two vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) with an angle \\( \\theta \\) between them, as shown below. Observe that the angle \\( \\theta \\) between vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) is the difference between the angles \\( \\theta_a \\) and \\( \\theta_b \\) from horizontal. If we use the angle sum formula for cosine, we have $$ \\begin{aligned} a b \\cos\\theta &= a b \\cos(\\theta_b - \\theta_a) \\\\ &= a b (\\cos\\theta_b \\cos\\theta_a + \\sin\\theta_b \\sin\\theta_a) \\end{aligned} $$ We now want to express the sine and cosine of \\( \\theta_a \\) and \\( \\theta_b \\) in terms of the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\). We re-arrange the expression so that we can use the fact that \\( a_1 = a \\cos\\theta_a \\) and \\( a_2 = a \\sin\\theta_a \\), and similarly for \\( \\vec{b} \\). This gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} a b \\cos\\theta &= (a \\cos\\theta_a) (b \\cos\\theta_b) + (a \\sin\\theta_a) (b \\sin\\theta_b) \\\\ &= a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\end{aligned} $$ The fact that we can write the dot product in terms of components as well as in terms of lengths and angle is very helpful for calculating the length and angles of vectors from the component representations. Length and angle from dot product. #rvv-el $$ \\begin{aligned} a &= \\sqrt{\\vec{a} \\cdot\\vec{a}} \\\\ \\cos\\theta &= \\frac{\\vec{b}\\cdot \\vec{a}}{b a}\\end{aligned} $$  The angle between \\( \\vec{a} \\) and itself is $\\theta = 0$, so \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a} = a^2 \\cos 0 = a^2 \\), which gives the first equation for the length in terms of the dot product. The second equation is a rearrangement of #rvv-ed. If two vectors have zero dot product \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 \\) then they have an angle of \\( \\theta = 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\rm\\ rad \\) between them and we say that the vectors are perpendicular, orthogonal, or normal to each other. Dot product identities Dot product symmetry. #rvi-ed $$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a} $$  Using the coordinate expression #rvv-es gives: $$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 = b_1 a_1 + b_2 a_2 + b_3 a_3 = \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}. $$ Dot product vector length. #rvi-eg $$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a} = \\|a\\|^2 $$  Using the coordinate expression #rvv-es gives: $$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a} = a_1 a_1 + a_2 a_2 + a_3 a_3 = \\|a\\|^2. $$ Dot product bi-linearity. #rvi-ei $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\cdot(\\vec{b} + \\vec{c}) &=\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + \\vec{a}\\cdot \\vec{c} \\\\ (\\vec{a} +\\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{c} &=\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} + \\vec{b}\\cdot \\vec{c} \\\\ \\vec{a} \\cdot (\\beta\\vec{b}) &= \\beta (\\vec{a} \\cdot\\vec{b}) = (\\beta \\vec{a}) \\cdot\\vec{b}\\end{aligned} $$  Using the coordinate expression #rvv-es gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\cdot (\\vec{b} + \\vec{c}) &= a_1 (b_1 + c_1) + a_2 (b_2 + c_2) + a_3 (b_3 + c_3) \\\\ &= (a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3) + (a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + a_3 c_3) \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} \\\\ (\\vec{a} + \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{c} &= (a_1 + b_1) c_1 + (a_2 + b_2) c_2 + (a_3 + b_3) c_3 \\\\ &= (a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + a_3 c_3) + (b_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + a_3 c_3) \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c} + \\vec{b} \\cdot \\vec{c} \\\\ \\vec{a} \\cdot (\\beta \\vec{b}) &= a_1 (\\beta b_1) + a_2 (\\beta b_2) + a_3 (\\beta b_3) \\\\ &= \\beta (a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3) \\\\ &= \\beta (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}) \\\\ &= (\\beta a_1) b_1 + (\\beta a_2) b_2 + (\\beta a_3) b_3 \\\\ &= (\\beta \\vec{a}) \\cdot \\vec{b}. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product The cross product can be defined in terms of components by: Cross product in components. #rvv-ex $$ \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} $$ It is sometimes more convenient to work with cross products of individual basis vectors, which are related as follows. Cross products of basis vectors. #rvv-eo $$ \\begin{aligned}\\hat\\imath \\times \\hat\\jmath &= \\hat{k}& \\hat\\jmath \\times \\hat{k} &= \\hat\\imath& \\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\imath &= \\hat\\jmath \\\\\\hat\\jmath \\times \\hat\\imath &= -\\hat{k}& \\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\jmath &= -\\hat\\imath& \\hat\\imath \\times \\hat{k} &= -\\hat\\jmath \\\\\\end{aligned} $$  Writing the basis vectors in terms of themselves gives the components: $$ \\begin{aligned} i_1 &= 1 & i_2 &= 0 & i_3 &= 0 \\\\ j_1 &= 0 & j_2 &= 1 & j_3 &= 0 \\\\ k_1 &= 0 & k_2 &= 0 & k_3 &= 1. \\end{aligned} $$ These values can now be substituted into the definition #rvv-ex. For example, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat\\imath \\times \\hat\\jmath &= (i_2 j_3 - i_3 j_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (i_3 j_1 - i_1 j_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (i_1 j_2 - i_2 j_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= (0 \\times 0 - 0 \\times 1) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (0 \\times 0 - 1 \\times 0) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (1 \\times 1 - 0 \\times 0) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= \\hat{k} \\end{aligned} $$ The other combinations can be computed similarly. + Warning: The cross product is not associative. #rvv-wc The cross product is not associative, meaning that in general $$ \\vec{a} \\times (\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{c}) \\ne (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}) \\times \\vec{c}. $$ For example, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\imath} \\times (\\hat{\\imath} \\times \\hat{\\jmath}) &= \\hat{\\imath} \\times \\hat{k} = - \\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ (\\hat{\\imath} \\times \\hat{\\imath}) \\times \\hat{\\jmath} &= \\vec{0} \\times \\hat{\\jmath} = \\vec{0}. \\end{aligned} $$ This means that we should never write an expression like $$ \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\times \\vec{c} $$ because it is not clear in which order we should perform the cross products. Instead, if we have more than one cross product, we should always use parentheses to indicate the order. Rather than using components, the cross product can be defined by specifying the length and direction of the resulting vector. The direction of \\( \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\) is orthogonal to both \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\), with the direction given by the right-hand rule. The magnitude of the cross product is given by: Cross product length. #rvv-el2 $$ \\| \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\| = a b \\sin\\theta $$  Using Lagrange's identity we can calculate: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\| \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\|^2 &= \\|\\vec{a}\\|^2 \\|\\vec{b}\\|^2 - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})^2 \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 - (a b \\cos\\theta)^2 \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 (1 - \\cos^2\\theta) \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 \\sin^2\\theta. \\end{aligned} $$ Taking the square root of this expression gives the desired cross-product length formula. This second form of the cross product definition can also be related to the area of a parallelogram. The area of a parallelogram is the length of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height, which is also the magnitude of the cross product of the side vectors. A useful special case of the cross product occurs when vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) is in the 2D \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane and the other vector is in the orthogonal \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction. In this case the cross product rotates \\( \\vec{a} \\) by \\( 90^\\circ \\) counterclockwise to give the perpendicular vector \\( \\vec{a}^\\perp \\), as follows. Cross product of out-of-plane vector \\( \\hat{k} \\) with 2D vector \\( \\vec{a} = a_1\\,\\hat\\imath + a_2\\,\\hat\\jmath \\). #rvv-e9 $$ \\hat{k} \\times \\vec{a} = \\vec{a}^\\perp $$  Using #rvv-eo we can compute: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{k} \\times \\vec{a} &= \\hat{k} \\times (a_1\\,\\hat\\imath + a_2\\,\\hat\\jmath) \\\\ & a_1 (\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\imath) + a_2 (\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= a_1\\,\\hat\\jmath - a_2\\,\\hat\\imath \\\\ &= \\vec{a}^\\perp. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product identities Cross product anti-symmetry. #rvi-ea $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times\\vec{b} = - \\vec{b} \\times\\vec{a}\\end{aligned} $$  Writing the component expression #rvv-ex gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} &= (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= -(a_3 b_2 - a_2 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\imath} - (a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} - (a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= -\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{a}. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product self-annihilation. #rvi-ez $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} = 0\\end{aligned} $$  From anti-symmetry #rvi-ea we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} &= - \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} \\\\ 2 \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} &= 0 \\\\ \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} &= 0. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product bi-linearity. #rvi-eb2 $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} \\times (\\vec{b} + \\vec{c})&= \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c} \\\\(\\vec{a} + \\vec{b}) \\times \\vec{c}&= \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c} + \\vec{b} \\times \\vec{c} \\\\\\vec{a} \\times (\\beta \\vec{b})&= \\beta (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})= (\\beta \\vec{a}) \\times \\vec{b}\\end{aligned} $$  Writing the component expression #rvv-ex for the first equation gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times (\\vec{b} + \\vec{c}) &= (a_2 (b_3 + c_3) - a_3 (b_2 + c_2)) \\,\\hat{\\imath} \\\\ &\\quad + (a_3 (b_1 + c_1) - a_1 (b_3 + c_3)) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &\\quad + (a_1 (b_2 + c_2) - a_2 (b_1 + c_1)) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= \\Big((a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\Big) \\\\ &\\quad + \\Big((a_2 c_3 - a_3 c_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 c_1 - a_1 c_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 c_2 - a_2 c_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c}. \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ The second equation follows similarly, and for the third equation we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times (\\beta \\vec{b}) &= (a_2 (\\beta b_3) - a_3 (\\beta b_2)) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 (\\beta b_1) - a_1 (\\beta b_3)) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 (\\beta b_2) - a_2 (\\beta b_1)) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= \\beta \\Big( (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\beta (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}). \\end{aligned} $$ The last part of the third equation can be seen with a similar derivation. Calculating the cross product The cross products of 3D vectors can be calculated by taking the determinant of specific components of the two vectors. It's best to start by writing a 3x3 matrix with the \\( \\hat{\\imath} \\), \\( \\hat{\\jmath} \\), and \\( \\hat{k} \\) vectors in the first row and the two vectors you are taking the cross product of in the next two rows. See the example below of the cross product between \\( \\vec{A} \\) and \\( \\vec{B} \\): The cross product can be written as #cp $$ \\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B} = (B_z * A_y - A_z * B_y) * \\hat{\\imath} - (A_x * B_z - A_z * B_x) * \\hat{\\jmath} + (A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x) * \\hat{k} $$  $$ \\begin{align} \\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B} &= \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{\\imath} & \\hat{\\jmath} & \\hat{k} \\\\ A_x & A_y & A_z \\\\ B_x & B_y & B_z \\end{vmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{vmatrix} A_y & A_z \\\\ B_y & B_z \\end{vmatrix} * \\hat{\\imath} - \\begin{vmatrix} A_x & A_z \\\\ B_x & B_z \\end{vmatrix} * \\hat{\\jmath} + \\begin{vmatrix} A_x & A_y \\\\ B_x & B_y \\end{vmatrix} * \\hat{k} \\end{align} $$ $$ \\text{where} \\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{vmatrix} = a * d - b * c $$ $$ \\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B} = (B_z * A_y - A_z * B_y) * \\hat{\\imath} - (A_x * B_z - A_z * B_x) * \\hat{\\jmath} + (A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x) * \\hat{k} $$ Vector projection The projection and complementary projection are: Projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) onto \\(\\vec{b}\\). #rvv-ep $$ \\operatorname{Proj}(\\vec{a},\\vec{b})= (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b}= (a \\cos\\theta) \\, \\hat{b} $$ Complementary projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) with respect to \\(\\vec{b}\\). #rvv-em $$ \\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b})&= \\vec{a} -\\operatorname{Proj}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) =\\vec{a} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b} \\\\\\left\\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\right\\|&= a \\sin\\theta\\end{aligned} $$ Adding the projection and the complementary projection of a vector just give the same vector again, as we can see on the figure below. Projection of \\( \\vec{a} \\) onto \\( \\vec{b} \\) and the complementary projection. As we see in the diagram above, the complementary projection is orthogonal to the reference vector: Complementary projection is orthogonal to the reference. #rvv-er $$ \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 $$  Using the definitions of the complementary projection rvv-em and projection rvv-ep, we compute: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{b} &= \\Big(\\vec{a} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b}\\Big) \\cdot \\vec{b} \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) (\\hat{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}) \\\\ &= a b \\cos\\theta - (a\\cos\\theta) b \\\\ &= 0. \\end{aligned} $$",

    "text": "Virtual work  In general, a force does work when it produces a displacement along its line of action. When we talk about virtual work, we're imagining those displacements becoming infinitesimally small. Work is defined as positive when the force and the displacement are in the same direction, and negative when the force and displacement are in opposite directions. Virtual work (\\( dU \\)) is the work produced by a force (\\( F \\)) over an infinitesimally small displacement (\\( dr \\)). Virtual work. $$ dU = \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r}\\ $$ Virtual displacements A virtual displacement is an infinitesimally small translation (\\( dr \\)) and/or rotation (\\( d\\theta \\)) that is possible in the system. Note: virtual displacements are assumed to be possible, but don't actually exist. Couple moments Couple moments can also do work! When a body's rotation and the moment vector are oriented in the same direction, the couple moment does work. For 2D problems, this is when both the moment and the rotation are oriented in the \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction using the right hand rule.

Virtual work of a couple moment. #cpl-mmt $$ dU = \\vec{M} \\cdot d\\theta \\hat{k} $$ Principle of virtual work If a body is in equilibrium, the sum of the virtual work done by all the forces and couple moments acting on the body is zero. We can use this principle to solve for the forces on systems. Virtual work equilibrium. $$ \\sum{dU} = \\sum{\\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r}} + \\sum{\\vec{M} \\cdot d\\theta}\\hat{k} = 0 $$ Virtual work analysis Steps for completing an analysis of a system using virtual work: Draw a free body diagram of the system, including a coordinate system. Sketch the \"deflected\" position of the system. Define the position coordinates (measured from a fixed point). Identify the components of the forces or moments that are parallel to the virtual displacements (the parallel line of action components). Remove all the forces that do not complete any work. Differentiate the position coordinates to obtain virtual displacement. Write the virtual work equation, expressing the virtual work of every force and moment. Factor out the common virtual displacement term (\\( dr \\) and/or \\( dr \\)) and solve. We can use virtual work to solve for the forces in a system without needing to solve for all of the support reactions. For example, if a truss is completely pinned on one end, it doesn't move, which means there is no virtual work completed on that pin because there are no virtual displacements (\\( dr = 0 \\)). This means that we can ignore it in our virtual work equation and don't need to solve for the reaction forces at the truss pin. + Example Problem: Virtual work analysis of a linkage system. #pin-trs Determine the force \\( P \\) needed to maintain equilibrium of the linkage at angle \\( \\theta_P \\). The spring is unstretched at \\( \\theta_S \\).  Draw the free body diagram of the structure. In this case, we have the support reactions at points A and G and the force P and spring force. Sketch the deflected position. Define the position coordinates from a fixed point. For this problem, we are defining the coordinates of points B and D from the fixed point A. $$ \\vec{r_B} = l sin\\theta \\hat{i} + l cos\\theta\\hat{j} $$ $$ \\vec{r_D} = 3l sin\\theta \\hat{i} + l cos\\theta\\hat{j} $$ Identify forces that have components parallel to the virtual displacements. For this problem, this would be the force of the spring \\( F_S \\) and the applied load \\( P \\). Remove forces that do no work. \\( A_x \\), \\( A_y \\), and \\( G_x \\) do not do any work (\\( dU = 0 \\)), so they can be removed. Differentiate the position coordinates. $$ \\vec{dr_B} = l cos\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta \\hat{i} - l sin\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta \\hat{j} $$ $$ \\vec{dr_D} = 3l cos\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta \\hat{i} - l sin\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta \\hat{j} $$ Apply the Principle of Virtual Work. $$ \\Sigma dU = dU_P + dU_{F_S} = 0 $$ Factor out the common virtual displacement term and solve (in this case, we will factor out \\( d\\theta \\)) $$ \\Sigma dU = \\vec{P} \\cdot d\\vec{r_D} + \\vec{F_S} \\cdot d\\vec{r_B} = 0 $$ $$ \\Sigma dU = (P \\hat{i}) \\cdot (3l cos\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta \\hat{i} - l sin\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta \\hat{j}) + (-F_s \\hat{i}) \\cdot (l cos\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta \\hat{i} - l sin\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta \\hat{j}) = 0 $$ Remember that the dot product of any \\( \\hat{i} \\) terms with any \\( \\hat{j} \\) terms is equal to zero because the vectors are perpendicular, which leaves us with: $$ \\Sigma dU = 3lP cos\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta -F_Sl cos\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta = 0 $$ Factor out the common \\( l cos\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta \\) term: $$ \\Sigma dU = (3P - F_S) l cos\\theta \\text{ } d\\theta = 0 $$ Solve for \\( P \\): $$ 3P - F_S = 0 $$ $$ P = \\frac{1}{3} F_S $$ Now that we have \\( P \\), we need to solve for the force in the spring. $$ F_S = k \\Delta x $$ $$ F_S = k (l-l_0) $$ $$ F_S = k (l sin\\theta_P - l sin \\theta_S) $$ Plug into our equation for \\( P \\) to get our final answer: $$ P = \\frac{1}{3} kl (sin\\theta_P - sin \\theta_S) $$ + Warning: Virtual work can be an easier method of solving for some problems. #vrt-wrk For simple problems, virtual work is about the same amount of work as the equilibrium equations.",

However, the selection of a coordinate system is arbitrary (materials don't know about coordinates - it's a mathematical construct!) and we could choose to express the stress state acting on any set of faces aligned with any coordinate system axes. Furthermore, we can relate the states of stress in each coordinate system to one another through stress transformation equations. Heads up! Cauchys stress theorem builds on this content in later solid mechanics courses.

The state of stress at a point in the body is defined by all the stress vectors \\( t^n \\) associated with all planes (infinite in number) that pass through that point. Cauchys stress theorem. $$ t^n=\\boldsymbol{T}\\boldsymbol{n} $$ Cauchys stress theorem states that there exists a stress tensor \\( T \\) (which is independent of \\( n \\)), such that \\( t^n \\) is a linear function of \\( n \\).

However, we can assume that the warping due to shear is small enough to be neglected, which is particularly true for slender beams (\\( L>5d \\)).

Necking Necking After ultimate stress (\\( \\sigma_u < \\sigma \\)), the middle of the material elongates before failure. Failure Also called fracture or rupture stress (\\( \\sigma_f \\)) is the stress at the point of failure for the material. Brittle and Ductile materials fail differently. Ductile materials generally fail in shear. There is a large region of plastic deformation before failure (fracture) at higher strain and necking. Ductile failure Axial \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maximum shear stress at \\(45^o\\) angle Torsion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maximum shear stress at \\(0^o\\) angle Brittle materials are weaker in tension than shear. There is a small plastic region between yield and failure (fracture) and no necking. Brittle failure Axial \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maximum normal stress at \\(0^o\\) angle Torsion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maximum normal stress at \\(45^o\\) angle Note the difference between engineering and true stress/strain diagrams: ultimate stress is a consequence of necking, and the true maximum is the true fracture stress. Example: Concrete is a brittle material. Maximum compressive strength is substantially larger than the maximum tensile strength. For this reason, concrete is almost always reinforced with steel bars or rods whenever it is designed to support tensile loads. Heads up! Strain Energy builds on this content in Engineering Materals. Deformation does work on the material: equal to internal strain energy (by energy conservation). $$ \\Delta U = \\int F_{z}dz = \\int \\sigma_{z}(\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z)d\\varepsilon_{z}\\ $$ Energy density. $$ u = \\frac{\\Delta U}{\\Delta V} = \\int \\sigma_{z}d\\varepsilon_{z}\\ $$ Can be generalized to any deformation: areas under stress-strain curves $$ u = \\int \\sigma d\\varepsilon \\quad \\text{or} \\quad u = \\int \\tau d\\gamma\\ $$ Heads up! Fatigue builds on this content in Engineering Materals and Mechanical Design. SN curve examples If stress does not exceed the elastic limit, the specimen returns to its original configuration. However, this is not the case if the loading is repeated thousands or millions of times. In such cases, rupture will happen at stress lower than the fracture stress - this phenomenon is known as fatigue. Other Derived Properties Directional Materials Isotropic: material properties are independent of the direction Anisotropic: material properties depend on the direction (ie; composites, wood, and tissues) Poisson's Ratio Poisson's ratio As illustrated in the figure above, when an object is being compressed it expands outward, and when stretched it will become thinner. Depending on the material, it may experience more or less lateral deformation for a given amount of axial deformation. The ratio that governs the amount of lateral strain per unit of axial strain is called Poisson's ratio. Axial (normal) strain. $$ \\varepsilon_{x} = \\frac{\\delta_x}{L}\\ $$ Poisson's ratio \\(\\nu\\). $$ \\nu = -\\frac{\\text{lateral strain}}{\\text{axial strain}} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_y}{\\varepsilon_x} $$ Typical range. #poisson_range $$ 0 < \\nu < 0.5\\ $$  Consider a cylinder with volume \\( V = A\\cdot L \\). We know that \\( A = \\frac{\\pi}{4}d^2 \\). Since the diameter is dependant on the change in length \\(dx\\) due to Poisson's ratio, we get $$ \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x} = 2d\\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\pi d}{2} $$ We use the chain rule to find the change in volume $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x}L + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} A \\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\pi d}{2}L + L \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\end{aligned} $$ By definition, $$ \\nu = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_y}{\\varepsilon_x} = -\\frac{\\frac{\\partial d}{d}}{\\frac{\\partial L}{L}} = -\\frac{\\partial d}{d}\\frac{L}{\\partial L}= -\\frac{\\partial d}{d}\\frac{L}{L\\partial x} = -\\frac{1}{d}\\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial x} \\implies \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial x} = -\\nu d $$ Returning to our first equation, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\pi d}{2}L + L \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\\\ &= -\\nu d \\frac{\\pi d}{2}L + L \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\\\ &= -\\nu \\frac{\\pi d^2}{2}L + L \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi d^2L}{4}\\left( 1- 2\\nu \\right) \\\\ &= V\\left( 1- 2\\nu \\right) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Since \\(\\partial V \\geq 0\\) and \\(\\nu > 0\\) in nicely behaved materials, \\( 0 < \\nu \\leq 0.5\\). In practice \\(\\nu = 0.5\\) only if the material is incompressible, thus in most materials \\(\\nu < 0.5\\). Lateral strain. $$ \\varepsilon_{z} = \\varepsilon_{y} = -\\nu\\varepsilon_{x}\\ $$ + Warning: Negative Poisson's Ratio (auxetics) #ngt-psn A negative Poisson's ratio is possible when the material structure is non-trival.",

    "text": "Vectors  A vector is an arrow with a length and a direction. Just like positions, vectors exist before we measure or describe them. Unlike positions, vectors can mean many different things, such as position vectors, velocities, etc. Vectors are not anchored to particular positions in space, so we can slide a vector around and locate it at any position. animate reset Change: length direction Two vectors, which may or may not be the same vector. Moving a vector around does not change it: it is still the same vector. Notation Some textbooks differentiate between free vectors, which are free to slide around, and bound vectors, which are anchored in space. We will only use free vectors. We will use the over-arrow notation \\( \\vec{a} \\) for vector quantities. Other common notations include bold \\( \\boldsymbol{a} \\) and under-bars \\( \\underline{a} \\). For unit (length one) vectors we will use an over-hat \\( \\hat{a} \\). Cartesian coordinate system Cartesian coordinates (also known as rectangular coordinates) are the regular \\(x,y\\) or \\(x,y,z\\) coordinates in 2D and 3D, with perpendicular straight-line axes. coordinate name range definition \\(x\\) horizontal \\(-\\infty \\lt x \\lt \\infty\\) horizontal distance from the \\(y\\)-axis \\(y\\) vertical \\(-\\infty \\lt y \\lt \\infty\\) vertical distance from the \\(x\\)-axis In 3D the \\(x\\),\\(y\\),\\(z\\) axes are oriented in right-handed order, so that fingers curling from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) means the thumb points in the \\(z\\) direction. Cartesian coordinate system, showing the origin \\(O\\) and three positions with their coordinates. Notation note When writing coordinates we can either list the coordinate values explicitly, like \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 1\\), or we can just write the numbers in an ordered list, like \\( (2, 1) \\). Writing them as a list assumes that we know which coordinate system we are using, and which order the coordinates are in. We will typically write the coordinate values explicitly to avoid confusion. This also applies to vector components. Did you know? While the idea of \\(x,y\\) coordinates specifying positions might seem obvious, the use of algebraic quantities to define geometry in this way was a major discovery of Ren\u00c3\u00a9 Descartes and a key event in the scientific revolution. Descartes was also instrumental in establishing the philosophical groundwork of The Enlightenment, and we owe to him the famous phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cCogito ergo sum\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Polar coordinate system Polar coordinates are an alternative 2D coordinate system that are useful for rotating or circular motion. coordinate name range definition \\(r\\) radius \\(0 \\le r \\lt \\infty\\) distance from the origin \\(O\\) \\(\\theta\\) angle \\(-\\pi \\lt \\theta \\le \\pi\\) angle from the \\(x\\)-axis in the \\(x\\)\u00e2\u0080\u0093\\(y\\) plane The two common extensions of polar coordinates to 3D are cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates. Polar coordinate system, showing the origin \\(O\\) and three positions with their coordinates. To define polar coordinates, we relate them to another known coordinate system, typically Cartesian coordinates as follows, where we use the atan2 function. Conversion between polar and Cartesian coordinates #rvp-ep $$ \\begin{aligned}x &= r \\cos\\theta& r &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\\\y &= r \\sin\\theta& \\theta &= \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)\\end{aligned} $$ Did you know? Angles can be measured in many different units. While radians are the most mathematically elegant unit, their use dates only from Roger Cotes in the 18th century. Degrees are a much older unit, dating back to the sexagesimal number system of the ancient Babylonians, and are convenient for celestial calculations because there are approximately 360 days in one year. Other units include grads (100 grads in a right angle) and mils (various definitions, all approximately equal to a milliradian). Notation note When solving for \\(\\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) we know that \\(\\tan\\theta = y / x\\). However, this does not necessary mean that \\( \\theta = \\tan^{-1}(y / x) \\), because \\(\\tan\\) is not a one-to-one function. For example, \\( \\tan^{-1}(1/1) \\) is the same as \\( \\tan^{-1}(-1/-1) \\). We thus need to take \\( \\theta = \\tan^{-1}(y/x) + \\pi \\) if the point is in quadrants II or III. An alternative is to use the atan2 function, which takes \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as separate arguments and correctly handles the conversion to \\(\\theta\\) in any quadrant. This function is available in all common programming languages, including C, MATLAB, Python, and others. Scientific calculators typically have special commands to convert to/from polar and Cartesian coordinates, which also automatically correctly handle the different quadrants. Units When using coordinates to describe the location of physical positions in the real world, we must always have appropriate units of length for the coordinates. For example, the following coordinates all specify the same position: $$ \\begin{aligned} x &= 2{\\rm\\ m} & x &= 6.56{\\rm\\ ft} & r &= 6.32{\\rm\\ m} & r &= 249{\\rm\\ in} \\\\ y &= -6{\\rm\\ m} & y &= -6 \\times 10^6{\\rm\\ \\mu m} & \\theta &= 1.25{\\rm\\ rad} & \\theta &= 71.6^\\circ. \\end{aligned} $$ It is important to distinguish between units and dimensions. The base dimensions include mass (M), length (L), and time (T), and can be combined to produce dimensions such as L/T or L\u00c2\u00a0T\\( ^{-1} \\) for velocity. Each physical quantity such as velocity has just one set of dimensions, and there is no choice in this. Units are particular ways of measuring dimensional quantities, and include the SI units kilogram (kg), meter (m), and second (s), as well as the customary U.S. units pound (lb) and foot (ft). A given physical quantity can be written in terms of many different units, although all of these must conform to the dimensions of the quantity. For example, velocity has dimension L/T and so it can be written in terms of the units m/s, ft/s, km/h, or many other choices. Angles are an example of a dimensionless quantity (having dimension 1), but they still have units, typically either radians (rad) or degrees (\u00c2\u00b0). Did you know? The SI unit system is the definitive system of measurement used in science and engineering. Other systems, such as U.S. customary units are defined in terms of SI units, so that an inch is defined to be exactly 2.54\u00c2\u00a0cm, for example. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains an excellent reference guide to SI units, including precise rules and style conventions for writing units in scientific and engineering work. Unit vectors A unit vector is any vector with a length of one. We use the special over-hat notation \\( \\hat{a} \\) to indicate when a vector is a unit vector. Any non-zero vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) gives a unit vector \\( \\hat{a} \\) that specifies the direction of \\( \\vec{a} \\). Normalization to unit vector. #rvv-eu $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{a} =\\frac{\\vec{a}}{a}\\end{aligned} $$  If we compute the length of \\( \\hat{a} \\) then we find: $$ \\| \\hat{a} \\| = \\left\\| \\frac{\\vec{a}}{a} \\right\\| = \\frac{\\|\\vec{a}\\|}{a} = \\frac{a}{a} = 1, $$ so \\( \\hat{a} \\) is really a unit vector, and it is in the same direction as \\( \\vec{a} \\) as they differ only by a scalar factor. Any vector can be written as the product of its length and direction: Vector decomposition into length and direction. #rvv-ei $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} = a\\hat{a}\\end{aligned} $$  This follows from rearranging #rvv-eu. Three vectors and their decompositions into lengths and directional unit vectors. Vectors bases To describe vectors mathematically, we write them as a combination of basis vectors. An orthonormal basis is a set of two (in 2D) or three (in 3D) basis vectors which are orthogonal (have 90\u00c2\u00b0 angles between them) and normal (have length equal to one). We will not be using non-orthogonal or non-normal bases. Any other vector can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors: Components of a vector. #rvv-ec $$ \\vec{a} = a_1 \\,\\hat{\\imath}+ a_2 \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + a_3 \\,\\hat{k} $$ The numbers \\(a_1, a_2, a_3\\) are called the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) in the \\( \\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\hat{\\jmath}, \\hat{k} \\) basis. If we are in 2D then we will only have two components for a vector. Writing a vector as the sum of scaled basis vectors. The scale factors are the components of the vector. Here \\( \\vec{a} = 3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath \\), so the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) are \\(a_1 = 3\\) and \\(a_2 = 2\\). We draw the symbol \\(\\odot\\) (arrow tip) to indicate a vector coming out of the page, and \\(\\otimes\\) (arrow fletching) to indicate an arrow going into the page. Two standard arrangements of the basis vectors when working in 2D. Either \\(\\hat\\jmath\\) is the vertical and \\( \\hat{k} \\) is out of the page, or \\( \\hat{k} \\) is the vertical and \\(\\hat\\jmath\\) is into the page. In both cases \\(\\hat\\imath\\) is horizontal. Notation note Just as for position coordinates, we can write the vector components \\(3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath\\) as the ordered list \\((3, 2)\\) if we know which basis we are using. Because we often will be using several bases simultaneously, we will generally write the components explicitly in the \\(3\\hat\\imath + 2\\hat\\jmath\\) form. Did you know? The use of the letter \\(i,j,k\\) for basis vectors is due to William Hamilton, who was motivated by thinking of basis vectors as extensions of the complex number \\(i\\). This notation was popularized by the book Vector Analysis: A Text Book for the Use of Students of Mathematics and Physics Founded upon the Lectures of J. Willard Gibbs (1901), by E. B. Wilson. This book also introduced the use of bold letters to represent vectors. Length of vectors The length of a vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) is written either \\( \\| \\vec{a} \\| \\) or just plain \\(a\\). The length can be computed using Pythagorus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 theorem: Pythagorus' length formula. #rvv-ey $$ a = \\|\\vec{a}\\| = \\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2} $$  First we prove Pythagorus' theorem for right-angle triangles. For side lengths \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and hypotenuse \\(c\\), the fact that \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) can be seen graphically below, where the gray area is the same before and after the triangles are rotated in the animation: animate reset Pythagorus' theorem immediately gives us vector lengths in 2D. To find the length of a vector in 3D we can use Pythagorus' theorem twice, as shown below. This gives the two right-triangle calculations: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\ell^2 &= a_1^2 + a_2^2 \\\\ a^2 &= \\ell^2 + a_3^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2. \\end{aligned} $$ Click and drag to rotate. + Warning: Length must be computed in a single basis. #rvv-wl The Pythagorean length formula can only be used if all the components are written in a single orthonormal basis. Computing the length of a vector using Pythagorus' theorem. Some common integer vector lengths are \\( \\vec{a} = 4\\hat\\imath + 3\\hat\\jmath \\) (length \\(a = 5\\)) and \\( \\vec{b} = 12\\hat\\imath + 5\\hat\\jmath \\) (length \\(b = 13\\)). + Warning: Adding vectors does not add lengths. #rvv-wa If \\( \\vec{c} = \\vec{a} + \\vec{b} \\), then \\( \\|\\vec{c}\\| \\ne \\|\\vec{a}\\| + \\|\\vec{b}\\| \\) unless \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) are parallel and in the same direction. It will always be true, however, that \\( \\|\\vec{c}\\| \\le \\|\\vec{a}\\| + \\|\\vec{b}\\| \\). This fact is known as the triangle inequality, for reasons that should be obvious. Did you know? Sets of three integers \\(a,b,c\\) where \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) are called Pythagorean triples. A long list of such triples is given on the Plimpton 322 clay tablet written by the ancient Babylonians around 1800\u00c2\u00a0BCE, although it is unclear how they generated these numbers. Pythagorean triples lead to complex mathematics, including the curious patterns shown below and Fermat's Last Theorem. The values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for all Pythagorean triples \\(a,b,c\\) with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) up to 2000. Changing bases To change the basis that a vector is written in, we need to know how the basis vectors are related. We do this by writing one set of basis vectors in terms of the other basis vectors. If we want to change from \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) to \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v} \\), then we need to write \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) in terms of \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v} \\) and then substitute the expressions. + Example: Example: Basis change. #rvv-xn For example, if we have \\( \\vec{a} = 3\\,\\hat{\\imath} + 2\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\) and we want to write this in the \\( \\,hat{u}, ,hat{v} \\) basis, then we need to know \\( \\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\) in terms of \\( \\,\\hat{u}, \\,\\hat{v} \\). From above we see that: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\imath} &= \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{u} - \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{v} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v} \\\\ \\hat{\\jmath} &= \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{u} + \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{v} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v}.\\end{aligned} $$ Then we can substitute and re-arrange: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= 3\\,\\hat{\\imath} + 2\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= 3\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v}\\right) \\\\ &= \\left(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\,\\hat{u} + \\left(-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\,\\hat{v} \\\\ &= \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{u} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat{v}.\\end{aligned} $$ If we want to convert back the other way then we would need to know \\( \\,\\hat{u}, \\,\\hat{v} \\) in terms of \\( \\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\). We can find this by solving for \\( \\,\\hat{u}, \\,\\hat{v} \\) above, giving: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{u} &= \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat\\jmath = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat\\imath + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat\\jmath \\\\ \\hat{v} &= -\\sin\\theta \\, \\hat\\imath + \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat\\jmath = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat\\imath + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\,\\hat\\jmath.\\end{aligned} $$ We can also write the general expressions for basis change, as below. Change of basis formulas. #rvv-eg $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} &=a_i \\, \\hat\\imath + a_j \\, \\hat\\jmath + a_k \\, \\hat{k}& \\vec{a} &=a_u \\, \\hat{u} + a_v \\, \\hat{v} + a_w \\, \\hat{w} \\\\[1em]a_i &= a_u u_i + a_v v_i + a_w w_i& a_u &= a_i i_u + a_j j_u + a_k k_u \\\\a_j &= a_u u_j + a_v v_j + a_w w_j& a_v &= a_i i_v + a_j j_v + a_k k_v \\\\a_k &= a_u u_k + a_v v_k + a_w w_k& a_w &= a_i i_w + a_j j_w + a_k k_w\\end{aligned} $$  We will derive the first set of equations (the second set are derived similarly). The vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) can be written in both the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath,\\hat{k} \\) and \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v},\\hat{w} \\) bases: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= a_i \\hat\\imath + a_j \\hat\\jmath + a_k \\hat{k} & \\vec{a} &= a_u \\hat{u} + a_v \\hat{v} + a_w \\hat{w}. \\end{aligned} $$ We can write each \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v},\\hat{w} \\) basis vector in terms of the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath,\\hat{k} \\) basis: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{u} &= u_i \\hat\\imath + u_j \\hat\\jmath + u_k \\hat{k} \\\\ \\hat{v} &= v_i \\hat\\imath + v_j \\hat\\jmath + v_k \\hat{k} \\\\ \\hat{w} &= w_i \\hat\\imath + w_j \\hat\\jmath + w_k \\hat{k}. \\end{aligned} $$ Substituting these expressions into \\( \\vec{a} \\) gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= a_u \\hat{u} + a_v \\hat{v} + a_w \\hat{w} \\\\ &= a_u (u_i \\hat\\imath + u_j \\hat\\jmath + u_k \\hat{k}) + a_v (v_i \\hat\\imath + v_j \\hat\\jmath + v_k \\hat{k}) + a_w (w_i \\hat\\imath + w_j \\hat\\jmath + w_k \\hat{k}) \\\\ &= (a_u u_i + a_v v_i + a_w w_i) \\hat\\imath + (a_u u_j + a_v v_j + a_w w_j) \\hat\\jmath + (a_u u_k + a_v v_k + a_w w_k) \\hat{k} \\\\ &= a_i \\hat\\imath + a_j \\hat\\jmath + a_k \\hat{k}. \\end{aligned} $$ Comparing the last two lines gives the component formulas. In 2D the change between two orthonormal bases is a rotation by an angle \\( \\theta \\), resulting in the change of basis expression below. Change of basis formula in 2D. #rvv-e2 $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= a_i \\, \\hat\\imath + a_j \\, \\hat\\jmath & \\vec{a} &= a_u \\, \\hat{u} + a_v \\, \\hat{v} \\\\[1em] a_i &= \\cos\\theta \\, a_u - \\sin\\theta \\, a_v & a_u &= \\cos\\theta \\, a_i + \\sin\\theta \\, a_j \\\\ a_j &= \\sin\\theta \\, a_u + \\cos\\theta \\, a_v & a_v &= -\\sin\\theta \\, a_i + \\cos\\theta \\, a_j \\end{aligned} $$  Elementary geometry gives the relationships between the basis vectors: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat\\imath &= \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{u} - \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{v} & \\hat{u} &= \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat\\jmath \\\\ \\hat\\jmath &= \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{u} + \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{v} & \\hat{v} &= -\\sin\\theta \\, \\hat\\imath + \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat\\jmath. \\end{aligned} $$ Thus we have the components: $$ \\begin{aligned} i_u &= \\cos\\theta & i_v &= -\\sin\\theta & u_i &= \\cos\\theta & u_j &= \\sin\\theta \\\\ j_u &= \\sin\\theta & j_v &= \\cos\\theta & v_i &= -\\sin\\theta & v_j &= \\cos\\theta. \\end{aligned} $$ Substituting these into #rvv-eg and ignoring the third components gives the desired expressions. Vector expressions are true no matter which basis we write the vectors in, even if they are written in different bases. + Example: Vector addition in different bases. #rvv-xa Adding \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) to get the result \\( \\vec{c} \\) is a well-defined operation even before any basis is used, so it cannot depend on the basis chosen.

(1) The dot product is \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 7 \\) and the vector lengths are \\(a = 3.6\\) and \\(b = 3.2\\), so \\(\\cos\\theta = 7 / (ab)\\) and \\(\\theta \\approx 53^\\circ\\).

This is because the dot product only depends on the lengths and angle between the vectors, which are real physical quantities that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change just because we use a different basis. However, we can also verify directly that the component equation #rvv-es for the dot product does not depend on which basis we use. To keep the algebra short, we will only do this in 2D. We compute the dot product using #rvv-es in the \\(\\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath\\) basis and substitute in the change-of-basis expressions #rvv-eg, giving: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} &= a_i b_i + a_j b_j \\\\ &= (u_i a_u + v_i a_v ) (u_i b_u + v_i b_v) + (u_j a_u + v_j a_v) (u_j b_u + v_j b_v) \\\\ &= (u_i^2 + u_j^2) a_u b_u + (v_i^2 + v_j^2) a_v b_v + (u_i v_i + u_j b_j) (a_u b_v + a_v b_u) \\\\ &= \\| \\hat{u} \\|^2 a_u b_u + \\| \\hat{v} \\|^2 a_v b_v + (\\hat{u} \\cdot \\hat{v}) (a_u b_v + a_v b_u) \\\\ &= a_u b_u + a_v b_v. \\end{aligned} $$ To get the last line we used the fact that \\( \\hat{u} \\) and \\( \\hat{v} \\) form an orthornormal basis, so that they each have length 1 (that is, \\( \\|\\hat{u}\\| = \\|\\hat{v}\\| = 1 \\)) and they are orthogonal (that is, \\( \\hat{u} \\cdot \\hat{v} = 0 \\) ). This then shows that $$ \\begin{aligned} a_i b_i + a_j b_j &= a_u b_u + a_v b_v \\end{aligned} $$ and so it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter which basis we use to compute \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\) , so long as we use an orthonormal basis. Projection and complementary projection The projection and complementary projection are: Projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) onto \\(\\vec{b}\\). #rvv-ep $$ \\operatorname{Proj}(\\vec{a},\\vec{b})= (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b}= (a \\cos\\theta) \\, \\hat{b} $$ Complementary projection of \\(\\vec{a}\\) with respect to \\(\\vec{b}\\). #rvv-em $$ \\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b})&= \\vec{a} -\\operatorname{Proj}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) =\\vec{a} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b} \\\\\\left\\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\right\\|&= a \\sin\\theta\\end{aligned} $$ Adding the projection and the complementary projection of a vector just give the same vector again, as we can see on the figure below. Projection of \\( \\vec{a} \\) onto \\( \\vec{b} \\) and the complementary projection. As we see in the diagram above, the complementary projection is orthogonal to the reference vector: Complementary projection is orthogonal to the reference. #rvv-er $$ \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 $$  Using the definitions of the complementary projection rvv-em and projection rvv-ep, we compute: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{b} &= \\Big(\\vec{a} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) \\hat{b}\\Big) \\cdot \\vec{b} \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\hat{b}) (\\hat{b} \\cdot \\vec{b}) \\\\ &= a b \\cos\\theta - (a\\cos\\theta) b \\\\ &= 0. \\end{aligned} $$ Change in length and direction Two useful derivatives are the rates of change of a vector's length and direction: Derivative of vector length. #rvc-el $$ \\dot{a} = \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a} $$  We start with the dot product expression #rvv-ed for length and differentiate it: $$ \\begin{aligned} a &= \\sqrt{\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a}} \\\\ \\frac{d}{dt} a &= \\frac{d}{dt} \\big( (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a})^{1/2} \\big) \\\\ \\dot{a} &= \\frac{1}{2} (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a})^{-1/2} (\\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\vec{a} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\dot{\\vec{a}}) \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{a^2}} (2 \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\vec{a}) \\\\ &= \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a}.\\end{aligned} $$ Derivative of vector direction. #rvc-eu $$ \\dot{\\hat{a}} = \\frac{1}{a}\\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a}) $$  We take the definition #rvv-eu for the unit vector and differentiate it: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{a} &= \\frac{\\vec{a}}{a} \\\\ \\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{a} &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\vec{a}}{a}\\right) \\\\ \\dot{\\hat{a}} &= \\frac{\\dot{\\vec{a}} a - \\vec{a} \\dot{a}}{a^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\dot{\\vec{a}}}{a} - \\frac{\\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a}}{a^2} \\vec{a} \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{a} \\big( \\dot{\\vec{a}} - (\\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a}) \\hat{a} \\big)\\\\ &= \\frac{1}{a} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a}).\\end{aligned} $$ Here we observed at the end that we had the expression #rvv-em for the complementary projection of the derivative \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\) with respect to \\( \\vec{a} \\) itself. An immediate consequence of the derivative of direction formula is that the derivative of a unit vector is always orthogonal to the unit vector: Derivative of unit vector is orthogonal. #rvc-eu2 $$ \\dot{\\hat{a}} \\cdot \\hat{a} = 0 $$  From #rvc-eu we know that \\( \\dot{\\hat{a}} \\) is in the direction of \\( \\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a}) \\) , and from #rvv-er we know that this is orthogonal to \\( \\vec{a} \\) (and also \\( \\hat{a} \\)). Recall that we can always write a vector as the product of its length and direction, so \\( \\vec{a} = a \\hat{a} \\). This gives the following decomposition of the derivative of \\( \\vec{a} \\).

This gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_r &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_r = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_z \\times \\hat{e}_r = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_{\\theta} \\\\ \\dot{\\hat{e}}_{\\theta} &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_{\\theta} = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_z \\times \\hat{e}_{\\theta} = -\\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_r \\\\ \\dot{\\hat{e}}_{\\phi} &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_{\\phi} = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{e}_z \\times \\hat{e}_z = 0 \\end{aligned} $$ where we used the fact that \\( \\hat{e}_r , \\hat{e}_{\\theta} , \\hat{e}_z \\) form a right-handed orthonormal basis to evaluate the cross products. A point \\(P\\) at a time-varying position \\((r,\\theta, z)\\) has position vector \\( \\vec{\\rho} \\), velocity \\( \\vec{v} = \\dot{\\vec{\\rho}} \\), and acceleration \\( \\vec{a} = \\ddot{\\vec{\\rho}} \\) given by the following expressions in cylindrical components. Position, velocity, and acceleration in cylindrical components. #rvy-ep $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{\\rho} &= r \\,\\hat{e}_r +z \\, \\hat{e}_z \\\\\\vec{v} &= \\dot{r} \\,\\hat{e}_r+ r \\dot\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_{\\theta}+ \\dot{z} \\,\\hat{e}_{z} \\\\\\vec{a} &= (\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\theta}^2) \\, \\hat{e}_r + (r \\ddot{\\theta} + 2 \\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta}) \\, \\hat{e}_{\\theta} + \\ddot{z} \\, \\hat{e}_z \\end{aligned} $$  From the coordinate expressions we see that the the position vector \\( \\vec{\\rho} \\), we know that \\( \\vec{\\rho} = r \\, \\hat{e}_r + z \\, \\hat{e}_Z \\). Differentiating this then gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v} &= \\dot{\\vec{\\rho}} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big(r \\, \\hat{e}_r + z \\, \\hat{e}_z\\Big) = \\dot{r} \\, \\hat{e}_r + r \\, \\dot{\\hat{e}}_r + \\dot{z} \\, \\hat{e}_z + z \\, \\dot{\\hat{e}}_z \\end{aligned} $$ and we substitute in the expression for \\( \\dot{\\hat{e}_r} \\) and \\( \\dot{\\hat{e}_z} \\) from above. Taking another derivative gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} = \\dot{\\vec{v}} &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big( \\dot{r} \\,\\hat{e}_r + r \\dot\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_{\\theta} + \\dot{z} \\,\\hat{e}_{z} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\ddot{r} \\, \\hat{e}_r + \\dot{r} \\, \\dot{\\hat{e}}_r + (\\dot{r} \\dot\\theta + r \\ddot\\theta) \\, \\hat{e}_\\theta + r \\dot{\\theta} \\dot{\\hat{e}_{\\theta}} + \\ddot{z} \\hat{e}_z + \\dot{z} \\dot{\\hat{e}_z} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ and again we can substitute the basis vector derivatives. Warning! We normally write \\( \\vec{r} \\) for the position vector of a point, but if we are using cylindrical coordinates \\( r,\\theta ,z \\) then this is dangerous. This is because \\( r \\) might mean the magnitude of \\( \\vec{r} \\) or the radial coordinate, which are different. To avoid this confusion we use \\( \\vec{\\rho} \\) for the position vector and \\( r \\) for the radial coordinate. Applications Shortest flight paths If we want to fly from Urbana, USA to Delhi, India, which path should we follow? The locations of the two cities are: Latitude Longitude Urbana \\(\\phi = 40^\\circ 6' 35'' \\rm N\\) \\(\\lambda = 88^\\circ 12' 15'' \\rm W\\) Delhi \\(\\phi = 28^\\circ 36' 36'' \\rm N\\) \\(\\lambda = 77^\\circ 13' 48'' \\rm E\\) Geographic coordinates are typically given in spherical coordinates, but without the radius and with the angles given in degrees, minutes, and seconds, with the latitude first, and the direction given as North/South or East/West rather than positive/negative. Also note that latitude is the elevation angle up from the equator, whereas spherical coordinates often use the inclination angle down from the polar axis. Plotting the city locations on a map of the Earth gives the figure below. Such a map can give a very misleading idea of the shortest route, however. Show: straight path on map shortest path Map of the Earth in an equirectangular projection, showing two possible flight paths from Urbana, USA to Delhi, India. Reference material Dot product Spherical coordinates Did you know? To get an idea of what it looks like to fly along a great circle path, we can view the crew movies taken from the ISS. The movies taken at night are especially evocative, such as this montage by Michael K\u00c3\u00b6nig. Technically the ISS is not following a great circle path around the Earth, because the Earth is rotating underneath it. However, because the speed of the ISS is much higher than the Earth's rotational velocity (90\u00c2\u00a0min versus 24\u00c2\u00a0h period), these paths are close to being great circles. Shortest paths on the sphere Finding the shortest distance between two points on the sphere is not a simple calculation given their latitude and longitude. As proved below, the shortest path on the sphere is always a great circle, which is the intersection of the sphere with a plane through the origin. The shortest distance calculation thus reduces to finding the angle between the vectors \\( \\vec{OA} \\) and \\( \\vec{OB} \\), which can be easily done by finding their dot product after changing them to rectangular coordinates.

Because the sphere is curved, a map projection cannot preserve both areas and angles simultaneously, leading to different trade-offs in choosing an appropriate projection for a given purpose. Some common projections are shown below. Equirectangular. $$ x = \\lambda, \\quad y = \\phi $$ Mercator: cylindrical, conformal (angle-preserving). $$ x = \\lambda, \\quad y = \\log\\left(\\tan\\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\phi}{2}\\Big)\\right) $$ Hobo-Dyer: cylindrical, area-preserving. $$ x = \\lambda, \\quad y = \\frac{\\sin\\phi}{\\cos^2(37.5^\\circ)} $$ Winkel tripel: non-cylindrical, compromise. $$ \\begin{aligned}\\small x &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\lambda \\cos\\phi_1 + \\frac{2\\cos\\phi\\sin\\frac{\\lambda}{2}}{{\\rm sinc}\\,\\alpha}\\right) \\\\ y &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\phi + \\frac{\\sin\\phi}{{\\rm sinc}\\,\\alpha}\\right) \\\\ \\alpha &= \\arccos\\Big(\\cos\\phi \\cos\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\Big) \\\\ \\phi_1 &= \\arccos\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\end{aligned} $$ You might also be interested in what your choice of map projection says about your personality. Proof that great circles are shortest paths Given any two points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) on the surface of the Earth, we choose coordinate axes and use spherical coordinates so that \\( A \\) is at \\( (r = r_0, \\theta = 0, \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\phi_0) \\) and \\( B \\) is at \\( (r = r_0, \\theta = 0, \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\phi_0) \\). Here \\( r_0 \\) is the radius of the Earth and \\( 0 \\le \\phi_0 \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). The total angle between \\( \\vec{OA} \\) and \\( \\vec{OB} \\) is \\( \\Delta\\phi = 2\\phi_0 \\), so the great-circle distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is \\( r_0 \\Delta\\phi \\). We will now prove that this is the smallest possible distance. Consider any path from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) on the Earth's surface. Suppose we travel along this path, starting at \\(A\\) at time \\(t = 0\\) and ending at \\(B\\) at time \\(t = 1\\). Then the position vector at time \\(t\\) is given by \\( \\vec{r}(t) \\) with spherical coordinates \\(r_0\\), \\(\\theta(t)\\), \\(\\phi(t)\\) and rectangular coordinates \\(x(t), y(t), z(t)\\). The length \\(L\\) of our path can be computed by integrating the speed from the start time to the end time: $$ L = \\int_0^1 \\| \\dot{\\vec{r}} \\| \\, dt= \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2} \\, dt. $$ To switch from rectangular to spherical coordinates we use the conversion: $$ \\begin{aligned} x &= r \\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi \\\\ y &= r \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi \\\\ z &= r \\cos\\phi. \\end{aligned} $$ Differentiating these expressions and substituting (or using the spherical velocity expression) gives the path length expression: $$ L = \\int_0^1 r_0 \\sqrt{\\dot{\\phi}^2 + \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\sin^2\\phi} \\, dt\\ge \\int_0^1 r_0 |\\dot{\\phi}| \\, dt\\ge r_0 \\Delta \\phi. $$ Here we have used the fact that \\( \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\sin^2\\phi \\ge 0 \\) to see that \\(L\\) must be at least as big as the great-circle distance \\(r_0 \\Delta \\phi\\). Thus the great-circle distance is the minimum path length between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the surface of the sphere. Did you know? All the calculations on this page have assumed a spherical model of the Earth, given by $$ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2, $$ where the radius of the Earth is \\(R = 6371\\rm\\ km.\\) Because it spins with a period of about 24 hours, the Earth bulges outwards so the center is further from the equator than from the poles. A shape that better approximates the true Earth is thus an ellipsoid, given by: $$ \\left(\\frac{x}{R_{\\rm xy}}\\right)^2+ \\left(\\frac{y}{R_{\\rm xy}}\\right)^2+ \\left(\\frac{z}{R_{\\rm z}}\\right)^2 = 1, $$ where \\( R_{\\rm xy} = 6378\\rm\\ km \\) and \\( R_{\\rm z} = 6357\\rm\\ km. \\) Computing shortest path distances on ellipsoids turns out to be much harder than shortest paths on spheres. One set of equations for doing this are known as Vincenty's formulae. There is no single best ellipsoid that fits the Earth. Instead there are many different ellipsoids in use, each of which fit the Earth better near different countries (e.g., NAD 83 for North America and WGS 84 for GPS world-wide). When even more accuracy is needed, such as for satellite orbit modeling, then true geoid models are used, with spherical harmonic expansions determined from satellite gravity measurements.",

Examples of conservative forces are gravity and spring force, where only the initial and final displacements are needed to calculate the work done by those forces. Examples of a non-conservative force are any type of drag forces (e.g friction, air resistance). The diagram below illustrates different paths and the work done by a conservative forces vs. a non-conservative force. If the force moving an object from point \\(A\\) to point \\(B\\) was conservative, the work done by that force in all paths is equal. If the force was non-conservative, the work done by that force is not equal, and it depends on the path length. Work done by Friction $$ W = \\Delta{E} = E_f - E_i $$ Work done by friction can be positive, zero, or negative. + Example Problem: Friction during rolling wihtout slip. #wdf-rws Which direction does friction force \\( \\vec{F} \\) act?

It is often convenient to derive equations of motion using momentum. Furthermore, it is related to kinetic energy and Newton's second law. Conservation of momentum is one of the three conservation laws in dynamics alongside conservation of energy and mass. Linear momentum of a rigid body. #rec-lm $$ \\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}_C $$ Unlike energy, momentum is a vector, and its direction is the same as the direction of the velocity of the center of mass. Furthermore, angular momentum is analogous to linear momentum. The angular momentum of a rigid body is shown below. Angular momentum of a rigid body rotating about principal axis \\(\\hat{a}\\) through point \\(O\\). #rec-am $$ \\vec{L}_O = I_{O,\\, \\hat{a}} \\vec{\\omega} $$ Momentum is also closely linked to force and moments. More specifically, the change in momentum and Newton's second law can be related. Newton's equations and linear momentum. #rec-mn $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{F} &= \\frac{d\\vec{p}_C}{dt}\\\\&= \\dot{\\vec{p}_C}\\end{aligned} $$  We begin with Newton's second law: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t\\vec{F} &= m\\vec{a}_C\\\\\t\t\t&= m \\frac{d\\vec{v}_C}{dt} \\\\\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ Assuming constant mass, then this can be rewritten as: $$ \t\t\t\\begin{aligned}\t\t\t\\vec{F} &= \\frac{d}{dt} (m\\vec{v}_C)\\\\\t\t\t& = \\frac{d\\vec{p}_C}{dt} \\\\\t\t\t& = \\dot{\\vec{p}_C}\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ + Warning: \\(\\vec{F} = \\dot{\\vec{p}_C}\\) is not applicable with variable mass. #rec-wm In the derivation of #ren-mn, the mass was assumed to be constant. In the case of a rocket expelling propellant, this does not work. See the rocket equation derivation further down. As aforementioned, angular momentum is analogous to linear momentum, so the above equation can also be derived using moments and angular momentum. Newton's equations and angular momentum. #rec-mm $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{M}_{C} &= \\frac{d\\vec{L}_C}{dt}\\\\&= \\dot{\\vec{L}_C}\\end{aligned} $$  We begin with Newton's second law: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t \\vec{M}_{C} &= I_{C, \\hat{a}}\\vec{\\alpha}\\\\\t\t\t&= I_{C, \\hat{a}} \\frac{d\\vec{\\omega}}{dt} \\\\\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ Assuming constant moment of inertia, then this can be rewritten as: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t \\vec{M}_{C} &= \\frac{d}{dt} (I_{C, \\hat{a}}\\vec{\\omega})\\\\\t\t\t& = \\frac{d\\vec{L}_C}{dt} \\\\\t\t\t& = \\dot{\\vec{L}_C}\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ From the above equations, it is clear to see that linear momentum is conserved if and only if the sum of external forces acting on the system is zero, and angular momentum is conserved if and only if the sum of external moments acting on the system is zero. Conservation of linear momentum. #rec-lmc $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{F} &= \\frac{d\\vec{p}_C}{dt}\\\\&= \\vec{0}\\end{aligned} $$ + Warning: Linear momentum is conserved if and only if the sum of external forces is zero #rec-wlmc As seen from #rec-lmc, linear momentum is conserved if the sum of the external forces is zero. This is why choosing an appropriate system and drawing a free-body diagram is crucial in determining whether linear momentum is conserved. See examples below. Conservation of angular momentum. #rec-amc $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{M}_{C} &= \\frac{d\\vec{L}_C}{dt}\\\\&= \\vec{0}\\end{aligned} $$ + Warning: Angular momentum is conserved if and only if the sum of external moments is zero. #rec-wamc As seen from #rec-amc, angular momentum is conserved if the sum of the external moments is zero. This is why choosing an appropriate system and and drawing a free-body diagram is crucial in determining whether angular momentum is conserved. See examples below. + Example Problem: An object in free-fall. #rec-xlmc An object is free-falling in the air under the influence of gravity. Take the system to be the object. Is linear momentum conserved?  Begin with a free-body diagram of the forces acting on the system: Write Newton's second law in terms of momentum: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t\t \\vec{F} &= \\frac{d\\vec{p}_C}{dt} \\\\\t\t\t\tm\\vec{g} & = \\frac{d\\vec{p}_C}{dt}\t\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ Verifying with conservation of linear momentum, it's clear to see that the sum of external forces is not zero, as the weight of the object is external to the system, and is not balanced by any other force. Therefore, linear momentum is not conserved. If however, the system was chosen to be the object and the Earth, then linear momentum is conserved, as by Newton's third law, the Earth exerts a force equal to \\(mg\\), and the object exerts a force \\(-mg\\) on the Earth. Therefore, the sum of external forces acting on the system is zero, and linear momentum is conserved. + Example Problem: A satellite in a circular orbit around the Earth. #rec-xamc A satellite of mass \\(m\\) is inserted into a circular orbit around the Earth. Take the system to be the satellite and the Earth. Ignoring the effects of gravity from any other celestial body, is angular momentum conserved?  Begin with a free-body diagram of the forces acting on the system. Assume the altitude of the satellite is negligble enough so that the gravitational acceleration is $g$. Otherwise, Newton's Law of Gravitation would need to be used to denote the forces. Write Newton's second law in terms of momentum: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t\t \\vec{M}_C &= \\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} \\\\\t\t\t\t\\vec{r} \\times m\\vec{g} - \\vec{r} \\times m\\vec{g} & = \\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}\t\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ Verifying with conservation of angular momentum, it's clear to see that the sum of external moments is zero, as the moment due to the pull of the Earth on the satellite is equal and opposite to the moment due to the pull of the satellite on the Earth. Moreover, those moments are equal to zero as the position vector $r$ and $mg$ are parallel, which yields a cross product of zero. Interestingly, angular momentum is also related to linear momentum if the object is a point mass. Angular momentum of a point mass \\(P\\) about a stationary point \\(O\\). #rec-al $$ \\vec{L}_{O} = \\vec{r}_{OP} \\times \\vec{p}_P $$  Begin with the relationship between angular momentum and moment at #rec-mm $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t \\vec{M}_C &= \\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}\\\\\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ For simplicity's sake, assume there's only one external moment due to a force applied at point \\(P\\). Recall the definition of moment due to a force applied at point \\(P\\): $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t\\vec{M}_O &= \\vec{r}_{OP} \\times \\vec{F}_P \\\\\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ Then #rec-mm becomes: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} &= \\vec{r}_{OP} \\times \\vec{F}_P\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ Using the relationship between linear momentum and force at #rec-mn , the above equation becomes: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} &= \\vec{r}_{OP} \\times \\vec{F}_P \\\\\t\t\t& = \\vec{r}_{OP} \\times \\frac{d\\vec{p}_P}{dt}\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ Multiplying both sides by $dt$ yields: $$ \t\t\td\\vec{L} = \\vec{r}_{OP} \\times d\\vec{p}_P\t\t\t $$ Recall integration by parts: $$ \t\t\t\\int u \\, dw = uw - \\int w \\, du\t\t\t $$ Setting \\( dw = d\\vec{p}_P and u = \\vec{r}_{OP} \\) , then: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\tu = \\vec{r}_{OP} \\quad \\quad \\quad du = \\vec{v}_P \\,dt \\\\\t\t\tw = \\vec{p}_P \\quad \\quad \\quad dw = d\\vec{p}_P\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ Therefore: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t\\int d\\vec{L} &= \\int \\vec{r}_{OP} \\times d\\vec{p}_P \\\\\t\t\t&= \\vec{r}_{OP} \\times \\vec{p}_P - \\int \\vec{p}_P \\times \\vec{v}_P \\,dt\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ However, \\( \\vec{p}_P = m\\vec{v}_P \\) as established in #rec-lm: $$ \\begin{aligned}\t\t\t\\vec{L} &= \\vec{r}_{OP} \\times \\vec{p}_P - \\int m\\vec{v}_P \\times \\vec{v}_P \\,dt\t\t\t\\end{aligned} $$ The cross product of a vector with itself is zero (cross product self-annihilation). So the integral of \\( \\int m\\vec{v}_P \\times \\vec{v}_P \\, dt \\) is a constant, which is the initial angular momentum. Assuming this is zero, we arrive at the desired expression. Impulse Impulse is a quantity that describes the effect of a resultant force acting over time. Naturally, impulse is related to momentum. Impulse. #rec-ij $$ \\vec{J} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\vec{F} \\, dt $$ Note that impulse, like momentum, is a vector. Its direction is the same direction as the net force. As seen from the equation above, this naturally leads to relating the impulse and momentum. Specifically, impulse is the change in momentum. Impulse-momentum theorem. #rec-jm $$ \\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p}_C $$  From Newton's second law and linear momentum at #rec-mn: $$ \\vec{F} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}_C}{dt} $$ Plugging into the impulse definition: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{J} &= \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\frac{d\\vec{p}_C}{dt} \\, dt \\\\&= \\int_{\\vec{p}_1}^{\\vec{p}_2} d\\vec{p} \\\\&= \\vec{p}_2 - \\vec{p}_1 = \\Delta \\vec{p}_C\\end{aligned} $$ + Example: The Rocket Equation #rec-xr As stated in the warning at #rec-wm, the relationship between Newton's equations and linear momentum are not applicable for a system whose mass is changing with time. To use that relationship, a few things must be changed. Consider the figure below of a rocket. The vector \\( \\vec{v} \\) is the velocity of the center of mass of the rocket relative to an inertially fixed point in space, \\(O\\). The vector \\( \\vec{c} \\) is the effective exhaust velocity. It is the average equivalent velocity at which propellant is ejected from the rocket relative to the rocket. We will explain further how it relates to what is often a characteristic value of the performance of an engine, called the specific impulse, denoted by \\( I_{sp} \\). Since the rocket is ejecting propellant, the rate at which this propellant is expelled is the mass flow rate, denoted by \\( \\dot{m} \\). In this case, it will be \\( -\\dot{m} \\) as the rocket is expelling propellant. To derive the rocket equation, we will need to calculuate the momentum at time \\(t\\), and at time \\(t + dt\\), a little time after expelling propellant. The momentum at time \\(t\\) is simply \\( \\vec{p}_1 = m\\vec{v} \\). The momentum at time \\(t + dt\\) consists of two parts: the momentum of the rocket without the mass lost to propellant expulsion, and the momentum of the propellant leaving the rocket. First, the momentum of the rocket at time \\(t + dt\\) is given by: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{p}_{2, rocket} = (m + \\dot{m}dt)(\\vec{v} + d\\vec{v})\\end{aligned} $$ You can expand the result to make sure it makes sense: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{p}_{2, rocket} &= (m + \\dot{m}dt)(\\vec{v} + d\\vec{v}) \\\\& = m\\vec{v} + md\\vec{v} + \\dot{m}\\vec{v}dt + \\dot{m}d\\vec{v}dt\\end{aligned} $$ The expression \\( m\\vec{v} \\) is the initial momentum of the rocket. The expression \\( md\\vec{v} \\) is the momentum of the rocket due to the velocity change. The expression \\( \\dot{m}\\vec{v}dt \\) is the momentum of the propellant at the initial velocity. (Note that \\( \\dot{m}dt \\) is the mass of the propellant since \\( \\dot{m} = -\\frac{dm}{dt} \\)). The expredssion \\( \\dot{m}d\\vec{c}dt \\) is the momentum of the propellant due to the velocity change. The second part of the momentum is the momentum of the propellant leaving the rocket. This expression is a little tricky, as the effective exhaust velocity is relative to the rocket as aforementioned, so we need to obtain the effective exhaust velocity \\( \\vec{c} \\) relative to the inertially fixed point, \\(O\\). Otherwise, Newton's equations cannot work. The exhaust velocity relative to \\(O\\) is: $$ \\vec{c}_{O} = \\vec{c}_{rocket} + \\vec{v}_{rocket, O} = \\vec{c} + \\vec{v} $$ Then the momentum of the propellant being exhausted: $$ \\vec{p}_{2, p} = -\\dot{m}dt(\\vec{c} + \\vec{v}) $$ So the total momentum at time \\(t + dt\\): $$ \\vec{p}_2 = (m + \\dot{m}dt)(\\vec{v} + d\\vec{v}) - \\dot{m}dt(\\vec{c} + \\vec{v}) $$ By the impulse-momentum theorem: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p}_C = \\vec{F} dt\\end{aligned} $$ Plugging into the above equation: $$ \\begin{aligned}(m + \\dot{m}dt)(\\vec{v} + d\\vec{v}) - \\dot{m}dt(\\vec{c} + \\vec{v}) - m\\vec{v} = \\vec{F} dt\\end{aligned} $$ Expanding: $$ \\begin{aligned}m\\vec{v} + md\\vec{v} + \\dot{m}\\vec{v}dt + \\dot{m}d\\vec{v}dt - \\dot{m}\\vec{c}dt - \\dot{m}\\vec{v}dt - m\\vec{v} = \\vec{F} dt\\end{aligned} $$ Simplifying: $$ \\begin{aligned}md\\vec{v} + \\dot{m}d\\vec{v}dt - \\dot{m}\\vec{c}dt &= \\vec{F}dt \\\\md\\vec{v} + \\dot{m}dt(d\\vec{v} - \\vec{c}) &= \\vec{F}dt\\end{aligned} $$ Dividing by $dt$: $$ \\begin{aligned}m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} + \\dot{m}(d\\vec{v} - \\vec{c}) &= \\vec{F} \\\\m\\vec{a} + \\dot{m}(d\\vec{v} - \\vec{c}) &= \\vec{F}\\end{aligned} $$ This shows that Newton's equations in linear momentum form do not work with variable mass, as \\( \\vec{F} - m\\vec{a} \\) is not zero in this case. Rearranging one more time: $$ \\begin{aligned}m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\dot{m}(d\\vec{v} - \\vec{c}) + \\vec{F}\\end{aligned} $$ Note the positive next to \\( \\dot{m} \\) is due to the loss of mass, as aforementioned earlier. The above equation is called the ideal rocket equation, or Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. Collisions A collision is when two or more objects exert forces on each other in a relatively short time. These problems are usually solved using conservation of momentum and energy. There are two general types of collisions: elastic and inelastic collisions. They are categorized by the state of the kinetic energy before and after the collisions: type of collision definition elastic collisions collisions where there is no loss in kinetic energy inelastic collisions collisions where there are losses in kinetic energy, typically due to internal friction Typically in collisions, it is assumed it takes place on a frictionless surface. This is important, since if friction were to be present, the system is not isolated, and therefore momentum is not conserved. The types of collisions that will be noted are perfectly inelastic and elastic collisions. The steps involved in solving a perfectly elastic collision with conservation of momentum and energy are detailed as follows: Solution procedure of perfectly elastic collisions. #rec-ecp $$ \\begin{aligned} m_1 \\vec{v}_{1, i} + m_2 \\vec{v}_{2, i} &= m_1 \\vec{v}_{1, f} + m_2 \\vec{v}_{2, f} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1, i}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2, i}^2 & = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1, f}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2, f}^2 \\end{aligned} $$ where subscripts \\(i, f\\) denote initial and final velocities, respectively. Below an animation to simulate a 1D perfectly elastic collision between two blocks. animation reset \\(m_1\\) \\(v_1\\) \\(m_2\\) \\(v_2\\) The solution procedure to solve a perfectly inelastic collisions is simpler, as the objects stick together after an inelastic collision. It involves using conservation of momentum only, as kinetic energy is lost in the collision, as aforementioned. Solution procedure of perfectly inelastic collisions. #rec-icp $$ m_1 \\vec{v}_{1, i} + m_2 \\vec{v}_{2, i} = (m_1 + m_2)\\vec{v}_f $$ where subscripts \\(i, f\\) denote initial and final velocities, respectively. Note the \\( \\vec{v}_f \\) shown above is the velocity of the center of mass. It is the same before and after the collision due to conservation of momentum where the net external force is zero (and therefore, the acceleration of the center of mass). Below is an animation to simulate a 1D perfectly inelastic collision between two blocks. animation reset \\(m_1\\) \\(v_1\\) \\(m_2\\) \\(v_2\\) One way collisions can be classified into elastic and inelastic collisions is using what is called the coefficient of restitution. It is the ratio of the final to initial relative speeds between two objects after the collision. It can be a way to solve collisions that are not classified as perfectly inelastic or elastic, as well as collisions of more than two objects. Coefficient of restitution. #rec-cor $$ e = \\frac{\\left|v_{2,f} - v_{1,f}\\right|}{\\left|v_{2,i} - v_{1,i}\\right|} $$ where subscripts \\(i, f\\) denote initial and final velocities, respectively.  Using the solution procedure of perfectly elastic collisions at #rec-ecp and assuming a one-dimensional collision: $$ \\begin{aligned}m_1 v_{1, i} + m_2 v_{2, i} &= m_1 v_{1, f} + m_2 v_{2, f} \\\\\\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1, i}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2, i}^2 & = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1, f}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2, f}^2\\end{aligned} $$ From conservation of kinetic energy: $$ \\begin{aligned}m_1 \\left(v_{1, i}^2 - v_{1, f}^2\\right) &= m_2 \\left(v_{2, f}^2 - v_{2, i}^2\\right)\\end{aligned} $$ Using the difference of two squares : $$ \\begin{aligned}m_1 \\left(v_{1, i} - v_{1, f}\\right) \\left(v_{1, i} + v_{1, f}\\right) &= m_2 \\left(v_{2, f} - v_{2, i}\\right) \\left(v_{2, f} + v_{2, i}\\right)\\end{aligned} $$ From conservation of linear momentum: $$ \\begin{aligned}m_1 \\left(v_{1, i} - v_{1, f}\\right) &= m_2 \\left(v_{2, f} - v_{2, i}\\right)\\end{aligned} $$ Divide the conservation of linear momentum equation: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\frac{m_1 \\left(v_{1, i} - v_{1, f}\\right)}{m_2 \\left(v_{2, f} - v_{2, i}\\right)} &= 1\\end{aligned} $$ Divide the conservation of kinetic energy equation: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\frac{m_1 \\left(v_{1, i} - v_{1, f}\\right)}{m_2 \\left(v_{2, f} - v_{2, i}\\right)} &= \\frac{\\left(v_{2, f} + v_{2, i}\\right)}{\\left(v_{1, i} + v_{1, f}\\right)}\\end{aligned} $$ Substituting the division from conservation of momentum into the division from the conservation of kinetic energy: $$ \\begin{aligned}1 &= \\frac{\\left(v_{2, f} + v_{2, i}\\right)}{\\left(v_{1, i} + v_{1, f}\\right)}\\end{aligned} $$ Rearranging: $$ \\begin{aligned}v_{1, i} + v_{1, f} &= v_{2, f} + v_{2, i} \\\\v_{1, i} - v_{2, i} & = -\\left(v_{1, f} - v_{2, f}\\right)\\end{aligned} $$ Finally, one more divison and taking the absolute value: $$ \\begin{aligned}1 & = \\frac{\\left|v_{2,f} - v_{1,f}\\right|}{\\left|v_{2,i} - v_{1,i}\\right|}\\end{aligned} $$ Which equals 1, which is the coefficient of restitution for a perfectly elastic collision. The range of values of the coefficient of restitution corresponds to different types of collisions. It is a dimensionless parameter, usually between 0 and 1. Those ranges are tabulated below. range type of collision \\(e = 0\\) This corresponds to a perfectly inelastic collision. The velocity of both objects after the collision is the same \\(0 < e < 1\\) This corresponds to an inelastic collision that happens in the real world, where some kinetic energy is lost \\(e = 1\\) This corresponds to a perfectly elastic collision, where no kinetic energy is lost. \\(e > 1\\) This corresponds to a superelastic collision, where energy is gained/released, like a chemical reaction, a reduction of rotational energy. Did you know? Counting the number of collisions with two simple objects, such as blocks, billiard balls, can be used to estimate \\(\\pi\\) to any accuracy. Mathematician Gregory Galperin of Eastern Illinois University discovered this in 1995 and published this in 2003. Famous YouTuber 3Blue1Brown made a video on this explaining this seemingly paradoxical result. However, looking at the velocity phase space, which is graphing the velocity of \\(m_1\\) on one axis, and the velocity of \\(m_2\\) on another. This arises from conservation of kinetic energy in elastic collisions. Did you know? There was a time when hitting the perfect shot in a game of billiards could result in the ball to explode. They were made from nitrocellulose, which is a plastic that is easily combustible, as an alternative to ivory. This corresponds to a coefficient of restitution greater than 1. Applications",

    "title": "Contact and rolling",
    "text": "Contact and Rolling  Rolling motion A special case of rigid body motion is rolling without slipping on a stationary ground surface. This is defined by motion where the point of contact with the ground has zero velocity, so it matches the ground velocity and is not slipping. Rolling without slipping on stationary ground surfaces: #rko-er $$ \\text{Contact point P has zero velocity}: \\quad \\vec{v}_P = 0 $$  Rolling without slipping means by definition that the contacting points have the same velocity. For a stationary ground the velocity is zero, so the contact point on the body must also have zero velocity. It is helpful to think about the motion of the body in two ways: The body rotates about the moving center \\( C \\). The body rotates about the instantaneous center at the contact point \\( P \\). These two ways of visualizing the motion can be seen on the figure below. animation reset show labels Movement: flat big flat rock inside 2-circle inside 3-circle inside rock outside 1-circle outside 2-circle outside rock Center \\(C\\) \\(C\\) velocity \\(C\\) acceleration \\(C\\) path Body ang. vel. ang. acc. \\(P\\) path inst. cent. \\(M\\) \\(P\\) velocity none \\( \\vec{v}_C \\) (trans.) \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{CP} \\) (rot.) \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) (total) all points \\(P\\) acceleration none \\( \\vec{a}_C \\) (trans.) \\( \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{CP} \\) (ang.) \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{CP}) \\) (cent.) \\( \\vec{a}_P \\) (total) all points Velocity and acceleration of points on a rigid body undergoing different rolling motions. Rolling on a flat surface The most common and also the simplest form of rolling occurs on a flat surface. animation reset show paths reverse direction Geometry and variables for rolling without slipping on a flat surface. While rolling, the velocity and acceleration are directly connected to the angular velocity and angular acceleration, as shown by the next equations. Center velocity and acceleration while rolling on a flat surface (Tangential-Normal Basis). #rko-ef $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_C &= r \\omega \\,\\hat{e}_t \\\\ \\vec{a}_C &= r \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_t \\end{aligned} $$  We begin by observing that the sign conventions in Figure #rko-ff mean that \\( \\vec\\omega = -\\omega\\,\\hat{e}_b \\). Now rolling without slipping means the contact point \\(A\\) must instantaneously have zero velocity, so using #rkg-er gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_C &= \\vec{v}_A + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{AC} \\\\ &= (-\\omega \\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times r \\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\ &= r \\omega \\,\\hat{e}_t. \\end{aligned} $$ Because the surface is flat, the tangential basis vector \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) is constant, and the radius \\(r\\) is also constant. Differentiating the velocity expression thus results in: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_C &= r \\omega \\,\\hat{e}_t \\\\ \\dot{\\vec{v}}_C &= r \\dot\\omega \\,\\hat{e}_t \\\\ \\vec{a}_C &= r \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_t. \\end{aligned} $$ Center velocity and acceleration while rolling on a flat surface (Standard Basis). #rko-ef2 $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_C &= -r \\omega_z \\,\\hat\\imath \\\\ \\vec{a}_C &= -r \\alpha_z \\,\\hat\\imath \\end{aligned} $$  Since the body is rolling without slipping, the contact point \\(A\\)'s velocity is instantaneously zero. Using rigid body equations: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_C &= \\vec{v}_A + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{AC} \\\\ &= \\omega_z r_{AC}^\\perp \\\\ &= -r \\omega_z \\,\\hat\\imath. \\end{aligned} $$ Differentiating to obtain acceleration results in: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_C &= -r \\omega_z \\,\\hat\\imath \\\\ \\dot{\\vec{v}}_C &= -r \\dot\\omega_z \\,\\hat\\imath \\\\ \\vec{a}_C &= -r \\alpha_z \\,\\hat\\imath. \\end{aligned} $$ Another way to express the connection between angular and linear velocity and acceleration is via the distance \\(s\\) traveled by the rolling body: Distance-angular relationships for rolling on a flat surface. #rko-eh $$ \\begin{aligned} s &= r \\theta \\\\ \\dot{s} &= r \\omega \\\\ \\ddot{s} &= r \\alpha \\end{aligned} $$  The contact point \\(P\\) and center \\(C\\) are offset by the constant vector \\( r\\,\\hat{e}_n \\) so \\( \\dot{s} = v_P = v_C = r\\omega \\), from #rko-ef. Because \\(r\\) is constant, differentiating the velocity expression gives \\( \\ddot{s} = r \\dot\\omega = r \\alpha \\), while integrating with zero initial displacement gives \\( s = r \\theta \\). While rolling, the contact point will have zero velocity but will have a centripetal acceleration towards the rolling center: Contact point \\(P\\) velocity and acceleration while rolling on a flat surface. #rko-eo $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_P &= 0 \\\\ \\vec{a}_P &= \\omega^2 \\,\\vec{r}_{PC} \\end{aligned} $$  By definition of non-slip rolling contact, the point of contact \\(P\\) has zero velocity. The acceleration can be computed from the center \\(C\\) with #rkg-e2: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a}_P &= \\vec{a}_C + \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{CP} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{CP}) \\\\ &= \\alpha r \\,\\hat{e}_t + (-\\alpha\\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times (-r\\,\\hat{e}_n) + (-\\omega\\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times \\Big((-\\omega\\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times (-r\\,\\hat{e}_n)\\Big) \\\\ &= \\alpha r \\,\\hat{e}_t - \\alpha r \\,\\hat{e}_t + \\omega^2 r \\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\ &= \\omega^2 \\,\\vec{r}_{PC}. \\end{aligned} $$ Rolling on curved surfaces When a circular rigid body rolls without slipping on a surface which is itself curved, the radius of curvature of the surface affects the acceleration (but not velocity) of points on the rolling body. Geometric quantities for rolling on a curved surface. #rko-eg $$ \\begin{aligned} \\left.\\begin{aligned} R &= \\rho - r \\\\ \\vec{\\omega} &= -\\omega \\,\\hat{e}_b \\\\ \\vec{\\alpha} &= -\\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_b \\end{aligned}\\right\\} & \\text{ when rolling on the inside of a curved surface} \\\\[1em] \\left.\\begin{aligned} R &= \\rho + r \\\\ \\vec{\\omega} &= \\omega \\,\\hat{e}_b \\\\ \\vec{\\alpha} &= \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_b \\end{aligned}\\right\\} & \\text{ when rolling on the outside of a curved surface} \\end{aligned} $$  These formulas are all choices of sign conventions for \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\alpha \\), and definitions of \\( R \\). Figure #rko-fc shows the appropriate geometry. Note that \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\alpha \\) are defined with positive values corresponding to motion in the tangential direction. + Warning: Radii of curvature \\(\\rho\\) and \\(r\\) may not be constant. #rko-wr The radius of curvature \\( \\rho \\) of the surface may be varying with position as the body rolls. If \\( \\rho \\) changes then this will also cause \\( R \\) to change. These two variables will only be constant if the surface is in fact perfectly circular. The center velocity for rolling on a curved surface is the same as for a flat surface, while the acceleration also depends on the radius of curvature of the surface: Center velocity and acceleration while rolling on a curved surface (Tangential-Normal Basis). #rko-ec $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{v}_C &= r \\omega \\,\\hat{e}_t \\\\\\vec{a}_C &= r \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_t+ \\frac{(r\\omega)^2}{R} \\,\\hat{e}_n\\end{aligned} $$  The two configurations shown in Figure #rko-eg must be considered individually. We will do the derivation for the case of rolling inside (the left diagram), as the rolling-outside case is very similar, but with different signs. We begin with the point of contact \\(P\\), which has zero velocity and so it is the instantaneous center of the body. Using #rkg-er with the expressions #rko-eg thus gives the velocity expression: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_C &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PC} \\\\ &= (-\\omega\\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times r\\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\ &= r \\omega \\,\\hat{e}_t. \\end{aligned} $$ Differentiating this velocity and using #rkt-ed gives the acceleration: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a}_C &= r \\dot{\\omega} \\,\\hat{e}_t + r \\omega \\,\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t \\\\ &= r \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_t + r \\omega \\frac{\\dot{s}}{\\rho} \\,\\hat{e}_n. \\end{aligned} $$ To replace \\( \\dot{s} \\) in this acceleration expression, we first consider the instantaneous center \\(M\\), which moves along the surface with speed \\( \\dot{s} \\) and tangential acceleration \\( \\ddot{s} \\). Thus from #rkt-ev: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_M &= \\dot{s} \\,\\hat{e}_t. \\end{aligned} $$ We can now compute the velocity of \\(C\\) from \\(M\\), as follows. Note that we cannot use equation #rkg-er because \\(M\\) and \\(C\\) are not fixed to the same body (\\(M\\) is not fixed to the body). Thus: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_C &= \\vec{r}_M + r\\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\ \\vec{v}_C &= \\vec{v}_M + r\\,\\dot{\\hat{e}}_n \\\\ &= \\dot{s}\\,\\hat{e}_t - r \\frac{\\dot{s}}{\\rho} \\,\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t \\\\ &= \\frac{(\\rho - r)}{\\rho} \\dot{s} \\,\\hat{e}_t \\\\ &= \\frac{R}{\\rho} \\dot{s} \\,\\hat{e}_t. \\end{aligned} $$ Comparing this expression for \\( \\vec{v}_C \\) to the one above, we see that: $$ \\begin{aligned} r \\omega &= \\frac{R}{\\rho} \\dot{s} \\\\ \\dot{s} &= \\frac{\\rho r}{R} \\omega. \\end{aligned} $$ This expression for \\( \\dot{s} \\) can be substituted back into our earlier equation for \\( \\vec{a}_C \\), giving: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a}_C &= r \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_t + r \\omega \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\rho r}{R} \\omega \\right) \\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\ &= r \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_t + \\frac{(r \\omega)^2}{R} \\,\\hat{e}_n. \\end{aligned} $$ The case of rolling on the outside of the curved surface (the right diagram in Figure #rko-fc) is similar to the above but with the different sign conventions from #rko-eg. The final expressions in #rko-ec apply to rolling on both the inside and outside. Center velocity and acceleration while rolling on a curved surface (I-J Basis). #rko-ec2 \\( \\text{Rolling on the inside}: \\) $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{v}_C &= -r \\omega_z \\,\\hat{I}\\\\\\vec{a}_C &= -r \\alpha_z \\,\\hat{I}+ \\frac{(r\\omega)^2}{R} \\,\\hat{J}\\end{aligned} $$ \\( \\text{Rolling on the outside}: \\) $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{v}_C &= -r \\omega_z \\,\\hat{I}\\\\\\vec{a}_C &= -r \\alpha_z \\,\\hat{I}- \\frac{(r\\omega)^2}{R} \\,\\hat{J}\\end{aligned} $$  By defining positive \\( \\hat{J} \\) as always pointing towards the center of the body rolling, i.e \\( \\hat{J} = -\\hat{e}_n \\) for rolling on the outside, and \\( \\hat{J} = \\hat{e}_n \\) for rolling on the inside, and \\( \\hat{I} \\) to make a right-handed set (i.e \\( \\hat{I} \\times \\hat{J} = \\hat{k} \\)) we can obtain the expressions above. The angular velocity of the rolling rigid body can be related to the derivative \\( \\dot{s} \\) of the distance traveled on the surface as follows. In the special case of a perfectly circular surface, the angular acceleration also has a simple relationship with \\( \\ddot{s} \\). Distance-angular relationships for rolling on a curved surface. #rko-ew $$ \\begin{aligned}\\omega &= \\frac{R}{\\rho r} \\dot{s} \\quad \\text{on any curved surface} \\\\\\alpha &= \\frac{R}{\\rho r} \\ddot{s} \\quad \\text{on a circular surface}\\end{aligned} $$  See the derivation for #rko-ec, where the relationship between \\(\\omega\\) and \\( \\dot{s} \\) is obtained. If the surface is exactly circular then by definition $\\rho$ and \\(r\\) are constant, so differentiating the angular velocity expression immediately gives the angular acceleration equation. Just as with rolling on a flat surface, when a rigid body rolls on a curved surface the contact point has zero velocity but nonzero acceleration, as shown below. Contact point \\(P\\) velocity and acceleration while rolling on a curved surface. #rko-ep $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{v}_P &= 0 \\\\\\vec{a}_P &= \\frac{\\rho}{R} \\omega^2 \\,\\vec{r}_{PC}\\end{aligned} $$  The derivations for rolling on the inside or outside of a surface are different. Here we show the rolling inside case, as the outside case is very similar. By definition the contact point \\(P\\) has zero velocity. The acceleration can be computed from the center \\(C\\): $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a}_P &= \\vec{a}_C + \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{CP} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{CP}) \\\\ &= r \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_t + \\frac{(r\\omega)^2}{R} \\,\\hat{e}_n + (-\\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times (-r\\,\\hat{e}_n) + (-\\omega \\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times \\Big( (-\\omega \\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times (-r\\,\\hat{e}_n) \\Big) \\\\ &= r \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_t + \\frac{(r\\omega)^2}{R} \\,\\hat{e}_n - r \\alpha \\,\\hat{e}_t + r \\omega^2 \\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\ &= \\frac{(r + R)}{R} r \\omega^2 \\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\ &= \\frac{\\rho}{R} \\omega^2 \\,\\vec{r}_{PC}. \\end{aligned} $$ Applications",

The center of mass of a rigid body can be calculated as follows: Center of mass \\(C\\) of a rigid body. #rcm-cm $$ \\begin{gathered} \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m}\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ \\( \\vec{r} \\) is the vector from a reference origin \\( O \\) to \\( dV \\). The integral term \\( \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\) is known as the \"first moment of mass\".  The center of mass of a collection of particles is given by the finite sum: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\, \\vec{r}_i $$ Therefore, for a continuous mass distribution and infinite number of particles, the sum becomes an integral and the masses become the mass of an infinitesimally small element on the rigid body: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m}\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\vec{r} dm $$ Where \\( dm = \\rho \\, dV \\) from the differential of #rcm-tm.

Where is the center of mass \\( \\vec{r}_C \\)located?  In order to figure out where the center of mass is located, we will need to choose an origin. The origin chosen in this instant is where the base and height begin, as shown. Using the center of mass formula will allow us to calculate the vector shown below (i.e we are calculating \\( \\vec{r}_{OC} \\)). Using the formula #rcm-cm: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_C &= \\frac{1}{m} \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{m} \\iint_{A} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, tdA \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Where \\( A \\) represents the surface area of the plate, and \\( t \\) is the thickness. We will assume the thickness is 1, as we are only interested in the center of mass in the \\( x \\)-\\( y \\) plane. Our triple integral with \\( dV \\)instead becomes a double integral with \\( dV = t dA \\). We therefore have: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\int_{y_1}^{y_2} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dA $$ We will redraw the figure and show the \\(dA\\) element. We will also find the \\(x\\)-coordinate and \\(y\\)-coordinate ranges for the body. Examining the figure above, we can see that the \\( x \\)-coordinate range is \\( 0 \\) to \\( w \\). Our \\( y \\)-coordinate range has a dependence on the \\( x \\)-value, and the equation of the hypotenuse is \\( y = h - \\frac{h}{w}x \\), using the point-slope formula. Therefore, the \\( y \\)-coordinate range is \\( 0 \\) to \\( h - \\frac{h}{w}x \\). As a result of this, we will have to integrate with respect to \\( y \\) first. All in all, our center of mass equation becomes: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dydx $$ where \\( vec{r} \\) is the distance to the \\( dA \\) element. We can see the coordinates of \\( dA \\) are \\([x,y]\\). Thus, \\( \\vec{r} = x\\hat{\\imath} + y\\hat{\\jmath} \\). Therefore: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_C &= \\frac{1}{m} \\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\rho \\left(x\\hat{\\imath} + y\\hat{\\jmath}\\right) \\, dydx \\\\ &= \\frac{\\rho}{m} \\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\left(x\\hat{\\imath} + y\\hat{\\jmath}\\right) \\, dydx \\\\ &= \\frac{\\rho}{m} \\left[\\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\left(x\\hat{\\imath} \\, dy\\right)dx + \\int_{0}^{w} \\int_{0}^{h - \\frac{h}{w}x} \\left(y\\hat{\\jmath} \\, dy\\right)dx\\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{\\rho}{m} \\left[\\int_{0}^{w} x\\left(h - \\frac{h}{w}x\\right)\\hat{\\imath}dx + \\int_{0}^{w} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(h - \\frac{h}{w}x\\right)^2\\hat{\\jmath}dx\\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{\\rho}{m} \\left[\\frac{w^2 h}{6}\\hat{\\imath} + \\frac{wh^2}{6}\\hat{\\jmath}\\right] \\end{aligned} $$ where \\( \\frac{\\rho}{m} = \\frac{1}{A} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}wh} = \\frac{2}{wh} \\). Substituting that in yields: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{3}w \\hat{\\imath} + \\frac{1}{3}h \\hat{\\jmath} $$ Meaning the center of mass for a right-triangular plate is located at 1/3rd of the width, and 1/3rd of the height. This formula has been used to calculate the center of mass of different common shapes. Finding the center of mass allows us to treat complex shapes as point-masses with all their mass at the center of mass. To find the center of mass of a body made up of composite shapes, we simply do the weighted average of each body by using the fact above. Center of mass (C) of composite bodies. #rcm-cb $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{m_1 \\vec{r}_1 + m_2 \\vec{r}_2}{m_1 + m_2} $$ \\( \\vec{r}_i \\) is the center of mass of the \\(i\\)th body. The whole body \\( \\mathcal{B} \\) is composed of sub-bodies \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\)  Finding the center of mass of the whole body follows directly from the fact that the integral over the whole body is the sum of the integrals over the sub-bodies. That is, for \\( \\mathcal{B} = \\mathcal{B}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{B}_2 \\) (and \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\)not overlapping with \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\), we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_C &= \\frac{1}{M}\\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{M}\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{B}_2} \\rho \\vec{r} \\, dV \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{M}\\left[\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}_1} \\rho_1 \\vec{r}_1 \\, dV + \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}_2} \\rho_2 \\vec{r}_2 \\, dV \\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{m_1 \\vec{r}_1 + m_2 \\vec{r}_2}{M} \\\\ &= \\frac{m_1 \\vec{r}_1 + m_2 \\vec{r}_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\end{aligned} $$ + Example Problem: Center of mass of an L-shaped plate. #rcm-xl A solid uniform L-shaped plate has mass \\(m\\) and dimensions as shown. What is the location of the center of mass?  In order to figure out where the center of mass is located, we will need to choose an origin. The origin chosen here is the corner shown. Then we must realize that the L-shape can be decomposed into four square plates, as shown. Each square plate has the same mass, so: $$ m_i = \\frac{1}{4}m $$ Using the addition formula #rcm-cb: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i \\vec{r}_i $$ where: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_1 &= d\\hat{\\imath} + 3d\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ \\vec{r}_2 &= d\\hat{\\imath} + d\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ \\vec{r}_3 &= 3d\\hat{\\imath} + d\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ \\vec{r}_4 &= 5d\\hat{\\imath} + d\\hat{\\jmath} \\end{aligned} $$ Substituting in: $$ \\begin{aligned} x_C = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}md + \\frac{1}{4}md + \\frac{3}{4}md + \\frac{5}{4}md}{m} = \\frac{5}{2}d \\\\ y_C = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}md + \\frac{1}{4}md + \\frac{1}{4}md + \\frac{1}{4}md}{m} = \\frac{3}{2}d \\end{aligned} $$ Thus, the center of mass of the L-shape plate: $$ \\vec{r}_C = \\frac{5}{2}d \\hat{\\imath} + \\frac{3}{2}d \\hat{\\jmath} $$ And its location on the plate is shown below.

The moment of inertia expresses how hard it is to produce an angular acceleration of the body about this axis. That is, a body with high moment of inertia resists angular acceleration, so if it is not rotating then it is hard to start a rotation, while if it is already rotating then it is hard to stop. The moment of inertia plays the same role for rotational motion as the mass does for translational motion (a high-mass body resists is hard to start moving and hard to stop again). Moment of inertia about axis \\( \\hat{a} \\) through point (P). #rem-ei $$ \\begin{gathered} I_{P,\\hat{a}} = \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho r^2 \\,dV \\\\ (\\text{units: } \\rm kg\\ m^2) \\end{gathered} $$ The distance \\(r \\) is the perpendicular distance to \\( dV \\) from the axis through \\(P\\) in direction \\( \\hat{a}. \\) + Warning: Mass moments of inertia are different to area moments of inertia. #rem-wm Be advised that the \"moment of inertia\" encountered in Statics is not the same as the moment of inertia used in Dynamics. Strictly speaking, the \"moment of inertia\" from Statics shouldn't even be called \"moment of inertia.\" What it really is is the \"second moment of area.\" Below are the definitions of two such second moments of area: $$ J_{xx}=\\iint_{A}{y^{2}dA} $$ $$ J_{yy}=\\iint_{A}{x^{2}dA} $$ In contrast, the moment of inertia (about the \\(z\\)-axis) is defined as stated above. For example, a rectangle of base \\(b\\) and height \\(h\\) has the following moments about its centroid \\(C\\): $$ J^{C}_{xx}=\\frac{1}{12}bh^{3} $$ $$ J^{C}_{yy}=\\frac{1}{12}b^{3}h $$ $$ I^{C}_{zz}=\\frac{1}{12}m(b^{2}+h^{2}) $$ Notice that the dimensions of the two quantities are different. While the dimension of second moment of area is \\( (\\text{length})^{4} \\), the dimension of moment of inertia is \\( (\\text{mass})(\\text{length})^{2} \\). When doing dynamics problems with moments of inertia, you should not use the formulas you remember for second moment of area instead. You will get the wrong answer! Observe that the moment of inertia is proportional to the mass, so that doubling the mass of an object will also double its moment of inertia. In addition, the moment of inertia is proportional to the square of the size of the object, so that doubling every dimension of an object (height, width, etc) will cause it to have four times the moment of inertia. Moments of inertia about coordinate axes through point (P). #rem-ec $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,x} &= I_{P,xx} = I_{P,\\hat\\imath} = \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (y^2 + z^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ I_{P,y} &= I_{P,yy} = I_{P,\\hat\\jmath} = \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (z^2 + x^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ I_{P,z} &= I_{P,zz} = I_{P,\\hat{k}} = \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\end{aligned} $$ The coordinates \\((x,y,z)\\) in the body are measured from point \\(P\\).  The distance\\(r\\) in the moment of inertia integral #rem-ei is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the infinitesimal volume \\(dV \\). If we are using rectangular coordinates \\((x,y,z)\\) measured from point \\(P\\), and the axis of rotation is one of the coordinate axes, then the perpendicular distance is very simple. As an example, consider the case when the axis of rotation \\( \\hat{a} \\) is the \\( \\hat{k} \\) axis, as shown in the figure. Then the perpendicular distance \\(r\\) satisfies \\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\\), giving the coordinate expression above. The other two coordinate axes are similar. + Example Problem: Moment of inertia of a square plate. #rem-xs A solid square uniform plate has mass \\(m\\), side-length \\( \\ell \\), and thickness \\( h \\). What is the moment of inertia about the \\(z \\)-axis through the center of mass \\(C\\)?  We will use the coordinate formula #rem-ec. To do this, we measure the position from the point \\(C\\) about which we are computing the moment of inertia, so the coordinate origin is at \\(C\\). The figure to the right shows the 3D configuration of the body, where we see that the \\(x\\)-coordinate range of the body is \\(-\\ell/2\\) to \\(\\ell/2\\), and the same for the \\(y\\)-coordinate, while the \\(z\\)-coordinate ranges from \\(-h/2\\) to \\(h/2\\). Taking the density of the plate to be \\(\\rho\\), we thus have: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{C,z} &= \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}x^3 + y^2 x\\right)\\right]_{x = -\\ell/2}^{x = \\ell/2} \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\ell^3 + y^2 \\ell \\right) \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\ell^3 y + \\frac{1}{3} y^3 \\ell \\right) \\right]_{y = -\\ell/2}^{y = \\ell/2} \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\ell^4 + \\frac{1}{12} \\ell^4 \\right) \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\rho \\frac{1}{6}\\ell^4 \\,dz \\\\ &= \\left[ \\rho \\frac{1}{6}\\ell^4 z \\right]_{z = -h/2}^{z = h/2} \\\\ &= \\rho \\frac{1}{6}\\ell^4 h. \\end{aligned} $$ The total mass of the plate is \\( m = \\rho \\ell^2 h \\), so we can write the moment of inertia as \\( I_{C,z} = \\frac{1}{6} m \\ell^2. \\) The square plate moment of inertia is actually a special case of the rectangular prism formula #rem-er with \\( \\ell_y = \\ell_z = \\ell \\) Did you know? We are always considering the moment of inertia to be a scalar value \\( I \\), which is valid for rotation about a fixed axis. For more complicated dynamics with tumbling motion about multiple axes simultaneously, it is necessary to consider the full 3\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u0097\u00c2\u00a03 moment of inertia matrix: $$ I = \\begin{bmatrix} I_{xx} & I_{xy} & I_{xz} \\\\ I_{yx} & I_{yy} & I_{yz} \\\\ I_{zx} & I_{zy} & I_{zz} \\end{bmatrix} $$ The three scalar moments of inertia from #rem-ec appear on the diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are called the products of inertia and are given by $$ I_{xy} = -\\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho xy \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz, $$ and similarly for the other terms. The angular momentum of a rigid body is given by \\( \\vec{H} = I \\vec{\\omega} \\), which is the matrix product of the moment of inertia matrix with the angular velocity vector. This is important in advanced dynamics applications such as unbalanced rotating shafts and the precession of gyroscopes. Parallel axis theorem Parallel axis theorem. #rem-el $$ I_{P,\\hat{a}} = I_{C,\\hat{a}} + m \\, d^2 $$ Here \\( d \\) is the perpendicular distance between the axes through \\( P \\) and \\(C \\) in direction \\( \\hat{a} \\), so \\( d = \\| \\operatorname*{Comp}(\\vec{r}_{CP}, \\hat{a})\\| \\).  To easily compute the moments of inertia relative to axes through \\( P \\) and \\( C \\) it is easiest to choose a coordinate system aligned with the rotation axis direction \\( \\hat{a} \\). We will choose coordinates \\( (x,y,z) \\) measured from the center of mass \\( C \\) and with the \\(z\\)-axis \\( \\hat{k} \\) in the direction of \\( \\hat{a} \\), as shown in the figure. As we integrate over the body with infinitesimal volume \\( dV \\) at position \\( (x,y,z) \\) from \\( C \\), we will write the distance from the axis through \\( C \\) as \\( r_c \\) and the distance from the axis through \\( P \\) as \\( r_P \\), as illustrated. The distance between the two rotation axes is \\( d \\). In the chosen coordinate system this means that: $$ \\begin{aligned} {r_C}^2 &= x^2 + y^2 \\\\ {r_P}^2 &= (x - x_P)^2 + (y - y_P)^2 \\\\ d^2 &= {x_P}^2 + {y_P}^2, \\end{aligned} $$ where \\( P \\) has position \\( (x_P, y_P, z_P) \\) in these coordinates. Computing the integral #rem-ec to find the moment of inertia about the axis through \\( P \\) in direction \\( \\hat{a} \\) now gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,\\hat{a}} &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho {r_P}^2 \\,dV \\\\ &= \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\left((x - x_P)^2 + (y - y_P)^2\\right) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\left(x^2 - 2 x x_P + {x_P}^2 + y^2 - 2 y y_P + {y_P}^2\\right) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz - 2 x_P \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho x \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &\\quad - 2 y_P \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho y \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz + ({x_P}^2 + {y_P}^2) \\iiint_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho {r_C}^2 \\,dV + d^2 \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho \\,dV \\\\ &= I_{C,\\hat{a}} + m d^2. \\end{aligned} $$ Here we used the coordinate representation of the center of mass to realize that the \\( x \\) coordinate of \\( C \\) is \\( x_C = \\frac{1}{m} \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho x \\,dV \\), but because our coordinates are measured from \\( C \\) we must have \\( x_C = 0 \\) and so \\( \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho x \\,dV = 0 \\). The integral of \\( \\rho y \\) is similarly zero. + Warning: Parallel axis theorem must start from center of mass \\( C \\). #rem-wl The parallel axis theorem does not apply to any two parallel rotation axes. The rotation axis on the right-hand-side of the equation must be through the center of mass \\( C \\), although the other axis can be through any point \\( P \\). + Warning: Parallel axis theorem \\( d \\) is perpendicular distance, not \\( r_{CP} \\). #rem-wp The distance \\( d \\) in the parallel axis theorem is the perpendicular distance between the axes through points \\( P \\) and \\( C \\). This will normally not be the same as the distance \\( r_{CP} \\) between \\( P \\) and \\( C \\), except in 2D problems or if it happens that \\( \\vec{r}_{CP} \\) is already perpendicular to the rotation axis \\( \\hat{a} \\). The distance \\( d \\) can be computed by taking the orthogonal complement of \\( \\vec{r}_{CP} \\) with respect to \\( \\hat{a} \\), so \\( d = \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{r}_{CP}, \\hat{a})\\| \\). + Example Problem: Moment of inertia of a square plate about a corner. #rem-xc A solid uniform square plate has mass \\( m \\), side-length \\( \\ell \\), and thickness \\( h \\). What is the moment of inertia about the \\( z \\)-axis through the corner \\( P \\)? Use the answer to Example Problem #rem-xs and the parallel axis theorem #rem-el.  In Example Problem #rem-xs we computed the moment of inertia of a square place about the center to be \\( I_{C,z} = \\frac{1}{6} m \\ell^2 \\). The parallel axis theorem #rem-el now gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,z} &= I_{C,z} + m \\, {r_{CP}}^2 \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{6} m \\ell^2 + m \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right)^2 \\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{3} m \\ell^2. \\end{aligned} $$ To check our answer, we can compute the corner moment of inertia directly by integrating with formula #rem-ec. To do this, we put the coordinate origin at the point \\( P \\) about which we wish to find the moment of inertia, as shown in 3D to the right. From this we see that the \\(x \\)range is \\(0\\) to \\( \\ell \\), the same for the \\( y \\) range, and the \\(z\\) range is \\(-h/2\\) to \\(h/2\\). The integral formula now gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,z} &= \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_0^{\\ell} \\int_{0}^{\\ell} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{0}^{\\ell} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}x^3 + y^2 x\\right)\\right]_{x = 0}^{x = \\ell} \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\int_{0}^{\\ell} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\ell^3 + y^2 \\ell \\right) \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\ell^3 y + \\frac{1}{3} y^3 \\ell \\right) \\right]_{y = 0}^{y = \\ell} \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\ell^4 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ell^4 \\right) \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\rho \\frac{2}{3}\\ell^4 \\,dz \\\\ &= \\left[ \\rho \\frac{2}{3}\\ell^4 z \\right]_{z = -h/2}^{z = h/2} \\\\ &= \\rho \\frac{2}{3}\\ell^4 h. \\end{aligned} $$ The total mass of the plate is \\( m = \\rho ell^2 h \\), so we can write the final expression for the moment of inertia is $$ I_{P,z} = \\frac{2}{3} m \\ell^2. $$ This is the same as the expression we obtained above using the parallel axis theorem, but clearly the parallel axis theorem version is much easier. One consequence of the parallel axis theorem is that the moment of inertia can only increase as we move the rotation point \\( P \\) away from the center of mass \\( C \\). This means that the point with the lowest moment of inertia is always the center of mass itself. A second consequence of the parallel axis theorem is that moving the point \\( P \\) along the direction \\( \\hat{a} \\) doesn't change the moment of inertia, because the axis of rotation is not changing as the point moves along the axis itself. Additive theorem Adding moments of inertia. #rem-ea $$ I^{\\mathcal{B}}_{P,\\hat{a}} = I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,\\hat{a}} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{P,\\hat{a}} $$ The whole body \\( \\mathcal{B} \\) is composed of sub-bodies \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\).  The addition of moments of inertia for sub-bodies to give the full moment of inertia follows directly from the fact that the integral over the whole body is the sum of the integrals over the sub-bodes. That is, for \\( \\mathcal{B} = \\mathcal{B}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{B}_2 \\) (and \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) not overlapping with \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\)), we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} I^{\\mathcal{B}}_{P,\\hat{a}} &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} \\rho r^2 \\,dV \\\\ &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B_1} \\cup \\mathcal{B}_2} \\rho r^2 \\,dV \\\\ &= \\int_{\\mathcal{B_1}} \\rho r^2 \\,dV + \\int_{\\mathcal{B}_2} \\rho r^2 \\,dV \\\\ &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,\\hat{a}} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{P,\\hat{a}}. \\end{aligned} $$ + Warning: To add moments of inertia they must be about the same axis. #rem-wa It is only valid to add together moments of inertia for different sub-bodies if each moment of inertia is computed about the same axis of rotation. For example, consider \\( I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{C_1,z} \\) and \\( I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{C_2,z} \\), which are the moments of inertia of bodies \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\) about each of their individual centers of mass \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) (with axis direction \\( z \\)). Now it is physically meaningless to form the sum \\( I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{C_1,z} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{C_2,z} \\), because each moment of inertia is about a different axis. We must first shift both moments of inertia to a common axis point \\( P \\) (perhaps by using the parallel axis theorem), and then we can meaningfully add them together. + Example Problem: Moment of inertia of an L-shaped plate. #rem-xl A solid uniform L-shaped plate has mass \\(m\\) and dimensions as shown. What is the moment of inertia about the \\(z\\)-axis through the corner \\(P\\)?  Recall that in Example Problem #rem-xs we computed the moment of inertia of a square place about the center to be \\( I_{C,z} = \\frac{1}{6} m \\ell^2 \\). To use this together with the parallel axis theorem #rem-el and the additive theorem #rem-ea, we must first realize that the L-shape can be decomposed into four square plates, as shown. Each small square body has the same mass and the same moment of inertia about its center, so: $$ \\begin{aligned} m_1 &= \\frac{1}{4} m \\\\ I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{C_1,z} &= \\frac{1}{6} m_1 (2d)^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{1}{4} m\\right) 4d^2 = \\frac{1}{6} m d^2, \\end{aligned} $$ and similarly for each other small square body. Now individual moments of inertia about the corner \\(P\\) can be found using the parallel axis theorem: $$ \\begin{aligned} I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{C_1,z} + m_1 \\, {r_{C_1P}}^2 = \\frac{1}{6} m d^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} m\\right) \\left(d^2 + (3d)^2\\right) = \\frac{8}{3} m d^2 \\\\ I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{C_2,z} + m_2 \\, {r_{C_2P}}^2 = \\frac{1}{6} m d^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} m\\right) \\left(d^2 + d^2\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} m d^2 \\\\ I^{\\mathcal{B}_3}_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,z} = \\frac{8}{3} m d^2 \\\\ I^{\\mathcal{B}_4}_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_4}_{C_4,z} + m_4 \\, {r_{C_4P}}^2 = \\frac{1}{6} m d^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} m\\right) \\left((5d)^2 + d^2\\right) = \\frac{20}{3} m d^2. \\end{aligned} $$ Here we observed that body \\( \\mathcal{B}_3 \\) will have the same moment of inertia as \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) , saving some computation. Combining the individual moments of inertia now gives us the total: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{P,z} &= I^{\\mathcal{B}_1}_{P,z} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_2}_{P,z} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_3}_{P,z} + I^{\\mathcal{B}_4}_{P,z} \\\\ &= \\frac{8}{3} m d^2 + \\frac{2}{3} m d^2 + \\frac{8}{3} m d^2 + \\frac{20}{3} m d^2\\\\ &= \\frac{38}{3} m d^2. \\end{aligned} $$ We could also directly compute the total moment of inertia using the integral formula #rem-ec, which would be quite complex. Basic shapes The moments of inertia listed below are all computed directly from the integrals #rem-ec. Point mass: moments of inertia #rem-ep $$ I_{P,z} = m r^2 $$ Rectangular prism: moments of inertia #rem-er $$ \\begin{aligned}I_{C,x}&=\\frac{1}{12}m({\\ell_y}^2+{\\ell_z}^2)\\\\I_{C,y}&=\\frac{1}{12}m({\\ell_z}^2+{\\ell_x}^2)\\\\I_{C,z}&=\\frac{1}{12}m({\\ell_x}^2+{\\ell_y}^2)\\end{aligned} $$  The calculation for any of the axes is the same, so we will only write out the derivation of \\( I_{C,z} \\) here. We use #rem-ec, which gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{C,z} &= \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\int_{-\\ell_y/2}^{\\ell_y/2} \\int_{-\\ell_x/2}^{\\ell_x/2} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\int_{-\\ell_y/2}^{\\ell_y/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{3}x^3 + y^2 x\\right)\\right]_{x = -\\ell_x/2}^{x = \\ell_x/2} \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\int_{-\\ell_y/2}^{\\ell_y/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}{\\ell_x}^3 + y^2 \\ell_x \\right) \\,dy\\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\left[ \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}{\\ell_x}^3 y + \\frac{1}{3} y^3 \\ell_x \\right) \\right]_{y = -\\ell_y/2}^{y = \\ell_y/2} \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{12}{\\ell_x}^3 \\ell_y + \\frac{1}{12} \\ell_x {\\ell_y}^3 \\right) \\,dz \\\\ &= \\int_{-\\ell_z/2}^{\\ell_z/2} \\rho \\ell_x \\ell_y \\frac{1}{12}\\left( {\\ell_x}^2 + {\\ell_y}^2\\right) \\,dz \\\\ &= \\left[ \\rho \\ell_x \\ell_y \\frac{1}{12}\\left( {\\ell_x}^2 + {\\ell_y}^2\\right) z \\right]_{z = -\\ell_z/2}^{z = \\ell_z/2} \\\\ &= \\rho \\ell_x \\ell_y \\ell_z \\frac{1}{12}\\left( {\\ell_x}^2 + {\\ell_y}^2\\right). \\end{aligned} $$ The total mass of the plate is \\( m=\\rho\\ell_x\\ell_y\\ell_z \\), so we can write the moment of inertia as $$ I_{C,z}=\\frac{1}{12}m\\left({\\ell_x}^2+{\\ell_y}^2\\right).\\ $$ Cylindrical thick shell: moments of inertia #rem-ey $$ \\begin{aligned}I_{C,x}&=I_{C,y}=\\frac{1}{12}m(3({r_1}^2+{r_2}^2)+\\ell^2)\\\\I_{C,z}&=\\frac{1}{2}m({r_1}^2+{r_2}^2)\\end{aligned} $$  To compute the integrals in #rem-ec it is convenient to switch to cylindrical coordinates: $$ \\begin{aligned}x &= r \\cos\\theta \\\\y &= r \\sin\\theta \\\\z &= z.\\end{aligned}\\ $$ The Jacobian of this coordinate transformation is: $$ \\begin{aligned}J &= \\begin{vmatrix}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z} \\\\\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z} \\\\\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial z}\\end{vmatrix}= \\begin{vmatrix}\\cos\\theta & -r \\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\\\sin\\theta & r \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\\end{vmatrix}= r \\cos^2\\theta + r \\sin^2\\theta= r.\\end{aligned}\\ $$ Starting with the \\( z \\) axis, the moment of inertia is thus: $$ \\begin{aligned}I_{C,z} &= \\iiint_\\mathcal{B} \\rho (x^2 + y^2) \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_{r_1}^{r_2}\\rho \\left( (r \\cos\\theta)^2 + (r \\sin\\theta)^2 \\right) \\,J \\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_{r_1}^{r_2}\\rho r^3 \\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left[\\rho \\frac{1}{4} r^4 \\right]_{r = r_1}^{r = r_2} \\,d\\theta\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{4} \\rho \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) \\,d\\theta\\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\rho \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) \\theta \\right]_{\\theta = 0}^{\\theta = 2\\pi} \\,dz \\\\&= \\int_{-\\ell/2}^{\\ell/2} \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) \\,dz \\\\&= \\left[ \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) z \\right]_{z = -\\ell/2}^{z = \\ell/2} \\\\&= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho \\ell \\left({r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right).\\end{aligned} $$ The total mass of the cylindrical shell is \\( m = \\rho(\\pi {r_2}^2 - \\pi {r_1}^2) \\ell \\) , so we can write the moment of inertia as $$ \\begin{aligned}I_{C,z}&= \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m}{{r_2}^2 - {r_1}^2}\\left( {r_2}^4 - {r_1}^4 \\right) \\\\&= \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m}{{r_2}^2 - {r_1}^2}\\left( {r_2}^2 + {r_1}^2 \\right) \\left( {r_2}^2 - {r_1}^2 \\right) \\\\&= \\frac{1}{2} m\\left( {r_2}^2 + {r_1}^2 \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ $$ Due to rotational symmetry of the cylinder, the moment of inertia will be the same about any axis orthogonal to \\( z \\) , so we will just write out the derivation for \\( I_{C,x} \\) here.

Euler's first law (acceleration form). #reg-ef1 $$ \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}_C $$ Euler's second law relates the moment of inertia about the center of mass \\(I_C\\) and the angular acceleration of the body to the total moment \\( \\vec{M}_C \\) (sum of all external moments) about the center of mass. It describes the rotational motion of the body. Euler's second law (angular acceleration form). #reg-es1 $$ \\vec{M}_C = I_C\\vec\\alpha $$ Recall that the total force on a particle is related to the linear momentum of the particle. Thus, if we extend that to rigid bodies, we have an alternative way to express Euler's first law: Euler's first law (momentum form). #reg-ef2 $$ \\vec{F} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}_C}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(m\\vec{v}_C) $$ Similarly, the total moment on a particle about a certain point is related to the angular momentum of the particle about the same base point. We can do the same thing as above, and extend it to rigid bodies, and obtain an alternative form to Euler's second law: Euler's second law (momentum form). #reg-es2 $$ \\vec{M}_C = \\frac{d\\vec{L}_C}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(I_C \\, \\vec\\omega) $$ Rotation about arbitrary reference points In some cases, using the center of mass as a reference point is not ideal, and we might encounter situations in which we would need to consider the dynamics about another point. We will begin by finding the angular momentum of a rigid body about any arbitrary point, and extend that from there. Angular momentum of a rigid body about an arbitrary point \\(P\\). #reg-lp $$ \\vec{L}_P = \\vec{r}_{PC} \\times m\\vec{v}_C + I_C \\, \\vec\\omega $$ We can differentiate the above expression with respect to time and obtain the time derivative of the angular momentum of the rigid body about point \\(P\\). This will yield two important special cases of rotations. Rate of change of angular momentum about an arbitrary point \\(P\\). #reg-lt $$ \\frac{d\\vec{L}_P}{dt} = \\vec{M}_P - \\vec{r}_{PC} \\times m\\vec{a}_P $$ The important special cases are outlined below. case result consequence \\(P = C\\) \\( \\vec{M}_P = \\vec{M}_C = \\frac{d\\vec{L}_C}{dt} \\) This is Euler's 2nd law. \\( \\vec{a}_P = \\vec{0} \\) \\( \\vec{M}_P = \\frac{d\\vec{L}_P}{dt} \\) The rigid body is rotating about a fixed point \\(P\\). This is another form of Euler's 2nd law. Applications Accelerating and braking 2D rigid body model Consider a car sitting stationary on the ground, as shown below. We will take the entire car plus wheels to be a single rigid body. Clearly this is inaccurate (the wheels can't turn), but it is still useful. We start with the car stationary, sitting on the road. Gravity acts downward through the center of mass, while there are upwards reaction forces on the wheels and corresponding equal and opposite forces downwards on the ground. Because the car is not accelerating, the total forces on the car are in balance, as we can see on the free body diagram. When the driver presses down on the gas pedal, this results in the car pushing back on the road, giving a net forward force on the driving wheels (the back wheels for our car), and the car accelerates up to cruising speed. Here we are including air resistance but neglecting rolling resistance, and while cruising at constant speed the driving force exactly balances the drag force from air resistance. When the driver presses down on the brake pedal, the car pushes on the road to slow down, giving backward forces on both wheels and causing the car to decelerate to a stop. accelerate brake free body diagram components animation Repeat the acceleration/braking cycle a few times while showing the free body diagram. Observe the horizontal and vertical forces of the road on the car wheels. Also view the forces both in vector components and as total force vectors. The vertical forces of the road on the car always need to balance the gravitational force, but we can see that the distribution between front and rear wheels changes as the car accelerates and decelerates. This is because the horizontal driving and braking forces are below the center of mass and produce a moment. The vehicle is not rotating, so this moment must be counteracted by the ground forces. The force directions mean that the rear wheels take more weight during acceleration, while the front wheels take more weight during braking. Traction, acceleration, and braking The maximum force with which the car can push against the road is limited by the friction coefficient of the tire multiplied by the normal force. This applies both during acceleration and braking. To accelerate as hard as possible, we should thus use a rear-wheel drive layout. If we accelerate too hard, however, then the back wheels will slip and experience wheelspin, because the dynamic coefficient of friction is lower than the static coefficient. While high-performance applications generally want to maintain traction in all cases, the impressive effects of traction loss are sometimes deliberately produced. Spinning the rear wheels in a burnout produces smoke as the tires vaporize due to the heat from friction. Drag racers perform a burnout at the start of a race to clean the tires and heat them to an optimal temperature. To easily produce a burnout a line lock can be installed to enable the brakes to be applied only to the front wheels (although this is often illegal on street cars). Alternatively, a burnout can be performed by disengaging the clutch, running the engine at a high revs, and then rapidly engaging the clutch. The high angular momentum of the engine then provides a rotational impulse to the rear wheels, causing them to lose traction. Even if traction is maintained during acceleration, a second problem that may occur is that the torque from the rear wheels can be enough to lift the front wheels off the ground, so that the vehicle performs a wheelie. This occurs very easily for motorbikes and BMX bicycles, due to a high center of mass to wheelbase ratio, but can also occur for cars with poor geometry and sufficient power. The problems of wheel slip and wheel lift-off occur in reverse while braking. Any car with well-maintained brakes has sufficient braking power to cause the wheels to lock, even in dry conditions with good traction. For this reason many cars now include anti-lock braking systems (ABS), which detect wheel locking and rapidly pulse the brake force to prevent locking. Even better than this are electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) systems, which apply the maximal brake force to each wheel while maintaining traction and control, better than any unassisted human driver could achieve. Due to the weight transfer to the front wheels during braking, the front brakes generally apply much greater force and thus wear out sooner than the rear brakes. Did you know? Using ABS to mean Anti-lock Brake System is an example of a backronym. This is where the name ABS came first, and then Anti-lock Brake System was made up later to fit the letters as an ackronym. In fact ABS comes from the German phrase Antiblockiersystem (literally: Anti Locking System). Traction, acceleration, and braking To understand how forces and moments act on the wheels, we need to separate out the single rigid-body model into multiple rigid bodies. The simplest version of this has one rigid body for the body, and four rigid bodies for the wheels. We will assume that the two front wheels always act as a pair (same forces, same motion), and similarly for the two back wheels. Again we start with the car stationary, and on the free body diagram we see the balance of vertical forces. Remember that the force shown on each wheel is really doubled, as there are two front and two rear wheels. If we now accelerate, then we see a clockwise moment applied to the rear (driving) wheels. This causes the wheel to rotate, but friction forces means that it must roll without slipping, so there must be a forward contact force causing it to accelerate forwards. Counteracting this is a backwards reaction force from the car on the wheel. On the car we see that there are equal and opposite forces and moments at the axles. Just as in the single rigid body case, we have a net horizontal force causing forward acceleration, and moment balance means that the weight of the car is transferred primarily to the rear wheels. accelerate brake free body diagram components animation Braking applies backwards moments to both wheels, causing them to slow down. To maintain non-slip, there is a backwards force from the ground at the point of contact. Because the wheel is slowing down, the car pushes forward on the axle. The ground/axle forces are trying to rotate the wheel forward, which must be counteracted by the braking moment. The braking moment is thus counteracting both the rotational inertia of the wheel, as well as the force couple from the ground/axle forces. Of these, the force couple is much larger (stopping a wheel without the car attached would be comparatively easy for the brakes). During braking we see again the weight being transferred to the front wheels. More complex models While we can learn a lot about car performance from the simple rigid body and multi-body models, there is a great deal of physics neglected by these models, which can be important for engineering design. Both the car and the tires are deformable bodies. The deformation of the tire is responsible for the contact patch which generates the friction forces that allow a car to accelerate and brake. The physics of the frictional contact between the tire and ground can be very complex, as can the geometry of the tire. Modern tires have complex tread patterns with grooves and lugs that are designed to channel away water and snow, maintaining traction even in challenging conditions. As well as being individually deformable, the wheels are are not rigidly connected to the car body as above, but they are actually connected by a suspension system, consisting of linkages, springs, and shock absorbers. These enable both a comfortable ride and safe handling of the vehicle. The simple models above included a simple model of air resistance, but they neglected rolling resistance. This is the force primarily produced by the tire being compressed and re-expanded at the contact with the ground as it rolls, producing a backward force on the wheel. Using steel wheels on steel can result in trains having up to ten times lower coefficients of rolling resistance than car tires, which is one reason for the efficiency of rail transport. Did you know? There is evidence that the wrinkling of fingers in water may serve the same purpose as tread patters on tires, improving traction in wet conditions by forming channels to carry away water. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that finger wrinkling relies on an active nervous system response, meaning that the fingers of corpses cannot wrinkle (but what about zombies' fingers?). Brake system design The above model shows equal brake force applied on the front and rear wheels. This both inefficient and dangerous, as the rear wheels will lock while the front wheels are still turning. See #avs for steering and sliding. We want to apply more force on the front brakes, so that we can deliver the most total force while still having no sliding. This can be achieved by electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) systems, however traditional systems are also possible. The basic outline of a brake system is that the brake pedal pushes on a master cylinder, which compresses hydraulic brake fluid in the brake lines. This then pushes on slave cylinders in each wheel, which push the brake pads onto the brake rotors (for disc brakes; drum brakes are somewhat different). The combination of slave cylinders and brake pads and their housing is called a brake caliper. To apply more force to the front brakes, one simple system used in practice is to have the front-wheel slave cylinders have a larger diameter than those on the rear wheels. Because the pressure in the brake lines is the same everywhere, the force exerted by the pistons is proportional to their cross-sectional area, resulting in more force with the larger-diameter front-wheel cylinders. Modern cars use more advanced systems. The master cylinder typically contains two pistons in a parallel arrangement, so that it can apply pressure to the front or rear brake lines even if the other brake line develops a leak. A metering valve applies pressure to the rear brakes before the front, improving vehicle steering stability and allowing mixed drum/disc systems to be used. A pressure differential valve detects brake hydraulic leaks by sensing different front/rear line pressures. A proportioning valve assists with applying a different pressure distribution to the rear brakes. Car model This is a 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback. The mass of the car body is 1100 kg and each of the wheels has mass 20 kg, giving a total mass of 1180 kg. We assume that the wheels are uniform cylinders. The dimensions of the car are shown below. $$ \\begin{aligned} h_1 &= {0.31\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_1 &= {0.98\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_2 &= {0.29\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_2 &= {1.41\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_3 &= {0.79\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_3 &= {1.41\\rm\\ m} \\\\ & & \\ell_4 &= {0.80\\rm\\ m} \\end{aligned} $$ The force of air resistance was computed above using the quadratic drag equation which is a good approximation for medium- to high-velocity motion in air: \\( F_{\\rm D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 C_{\\rm D} A \\) Here \\( F_{\\rm D} \\) is the drag force, \\( \\rho = 1.23\\rm\\ kg/m^3 \\) is the air density, \\(v\\) is the velocity, \\( C_{\\ D} \\) is the drag coefficient (taken to be 0.3 for the Mustang), and \\(A\\) is the reference area (approximately the cross-sectional area, taken to be \\(2.2\\rm\\ m^2\\) for the Mustang). Banked turns 2D Rigid body model We now use a single rigid body model for the bus and we will do everything in 2D. Below we see a front-on diagram of the bus, with the inside of the track to the left. If we turn on the free body diagram, then we see that the weight of the bus is supported by two forces, one on each wheel. If we increase \\(\\theta\\) then the weight is supported more by the down-slope wheel, and we also see sideways friction forces appear to stop the bus from sliding. If the slope becomes too steep, then the normal force on the up-slope wheel reverses direction, indicating that it is holding the wheel down onto the road. Physically this cannot happen, so at this point the bus would tip over. We needed this rigid-body model to understand this tipping behavior, as we couldn't model this with the point mass model. Depending on the value of the friction coefficient, the bus may either slide or roll first as \\(\\theta\\) increases. free body diagram components Road bank angle: \\(\\theta = \\; \\) 45\\(^\\circ\\) Bus speed: \\(v = \\; \\) 30 \\(\\rm m/s\\) If we now set the bank angle \\(\\theta\\) back to zero, we can start to increase the speed \\(v\\). Now we see that the wheel on the inside of the track takes less of the weight, and the friction forces now stop the bus from sliding outwards on the track. If the bus goes too fast then it will roll outwards on the track (assuming the friction coefficient is high enough that it didn't slide first). Having considered both a banked road with stationary bus, and a moving bus on a horizontal road, we can now combine them to see the advantage of having a banked road when the bus is cornering. Choose a bus velocity, and then change the bank angle \\(\\theta\\), so that the friction force is reduced (helping to avoid sliding) and the normal forces on the wheels are more evenly balanced (helping to avoid rolling). For any given speed, we can choose a bank angle so that there is simultaneously no sideways friction force and also exactly balanced normal forces. This is the safest bank angle for this speed. Design of roads, tracks, and rail A straight road generally has the center somewhat higher than the edges to allow water to run off. This is called cross slope or camber. When it is desired to have a banked turn, then the outer edge of the road is raised to produce superelevation, with the outer edge rising above both the center and the inner edge. The bank angle is chosen based on the radius of curvature of the turn and the expected speed of cars going around the turn, while still allowing for the fact that cars might be moving slowly or even stopped. The angle should thus not be chosen to eliminate all friction forces when cars are traveling at maximum speed, as this would be dangerous if traffic had to stop on the road. Velodromes are arenas with tracks designed for high-speed bicycle races, as shown below, with speeds up to 85 km/h. The bank angle on velodrome tracks is chosen to minimize sideways forces on the bicycles when they are traveling at near maximum speeds, so the angle chosen depends on the radius of curvature of the track corners. For example, the Blaine velodrome track pictured below is 250 m long and has a 43\u00b0 bank angle on the corners and 15\u00b0 banking on the straightaways. Bicycle riders on a banked turn at the Blaine velodrome, part of the National Sports Center in Blaine, Minnesota. Image source: flikr user flyinfoto (CC BY 2.0) (full-sized image). High-speed trains such as the French TGV operate at speeds of over 300 km/h and have run at up to 575 km/h. To accommodate cornering at such speeds, track bends are constructed with a large radius of curvature (at least 7 km for new tracks) and a bank angle of up to about 7\u00b0 (180 mm maximum superelevation with Standard gauge of 1435 mm). For railways, banking the track is know as cant. An alternative approach for cornering with trains is to leave the track relatively flat and to tilt the train as it travels around a corner. This allows high-speed trains to operate on regular tracks, while maintaining safety and comfort for the passengers. For example, the Queensland Rail Tilt Train operates at 180 km/h by tilting at up to 5\u00b0 around corners. As we see from our rigid body analysis above, tilting the train will help with avoiding tipping over at high speeds, but will not help with reducing horizontal friction forces. Even with a tilting train, entering a curve at too high a speed will lead to disastrous results. Did you know? The Blaine velodrome in Minnesota was designed by the famous Schuermann velodrome architects and built from the extremely durable African Afzelia hardwood. Velodrome races are always counter-clockwise and use special bikes with fixed chains (no freewheeling, no gears) and no brakes. The corners are scarily steep: Image credit: Tom McGoldrick (full sized image). Did you know? High-speed trains such as the French TGV and German ICE require many sophisticated engineering techniques to enable travel at extreme speed. Very smooth rails are needed, so the track is formed by welding the segments together into one precisely-aligned continuous steel line. The steel rails conduct heat too well for conventional welding, so thermite welding is used to join the track segments. At high speeds the train drivers are unable to see railway signals on the side of the track. Electronic signaling systems are used to communicate to the drivers, either through the tracks for the TGV or via additional cables for the ICE. Friction-based brakes produce too much heat, as they would need to absorb the kinetic energy of several hundred tonnes of train moving at over 300 km/h. Instead, dynamic breaking is used, in which the electric motors powering the trains are run in reverse as generators and the energy is shed as heat in resistor arrays. At extremely high speeds, the wheels themselves cannot provide sufficient traction to enable braking, so technologies like magnetic induction brakes are being developed, which directly push against the rails without involving the wheels at all.

The mass of the vehicle is 12.6 t and the dimensions are shown below. $$ \\begin{aligned} h_1 &= {0.31\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_1 &= {0.98\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_2 &= {0.29\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_2 &= {1.41\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_3 &= {0.79\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_3 &= {1.41\\rm\\ m} \\\\ & & \\ell_4 &= {0.80\\rm\\ m} \\end{aligned} $$",

A rotation consists of a rotation axis and a rotation rate. By taking the rotation axis as a direction and the rotation rate as a length, we can write the rotation as a vector, known as the angular velocity vector \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\).

Vector derivatives and rotations If a unit vector \\( \\hat{a} \\) is rotating, then the angular velocity vector \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) is defined so that: Derivative of unit vectors. #rkr-ew $$ \\dot{\\hat{a}} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{a} $$ Derivative of general vectors. #rkr-ed $$ \\begin{aligned}\\dot{\\vec{a}} = \\underbrace{\\dot{a}\\hat{a}}_{\\operatorname{Proj}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a})} +\\underbrace{\\vec{\\omega} \\times\\vec{a}}_{\\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{a}}, \\vec{a})}\\end{aligned} $$  Using the same approach as #rvc-em we write \\( \\vec{a} =a\\hat{a} \\) and differentiate this and use rkr-ew to find: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\dot{\\vec{a}} &= \\frac{d}{dt} \\big( a \\hat{a} \\big) \\\\&= \\dot{a} \\hat{a} + a \\dot{\\hat{a}} \\\\&= \\dot{a} \\hat{a} + a (\\vec\\omega \\times \\hat{a}) \\\\&= \\dot{a} \\hat{a} + \\vec\\omega \\times (a \\hat{a}) \\\\&= \\dot{a} \\hat{a} + \\vec\\omega \\times \\vec{a}.\\end{aligned} $$ Comparing this to #rvc-em shows that the two components are the projection and the complementary projection, respectively. Derivative of constant-length vectors. #rkr-el $$ \\dot{\\vec{a}} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}\\qquad\\text{if \\(\\vec{a}\\) is constant length}\\ $$  This can be seen from the fact that \\( \\dot{a} = 0 \\) if \\(a\\) is constant (a fixed length vector), substituted into #rkr-ed. Rotations in 2D In 2D the angular velocity can be thought of as a scalar (positive for counter-clockwise, negative for clockwise). This scalar is just the out-of-plane component of the full angular velocity vector. We can draw the angular velocity as either a vector pointing out of the plane, or as a circle-arrow in the plane, which is simpler for 2D diagrams. animate reset Show: derivative Comparison of the vector and scalar representations of \\(\\vec\\omega\\) for 2D rotations. In 2D the angular velocity scalar \\(\\omega\\) is simply the derivative of the rotation angle \\(\\theta\\) in the plane: Magnitude \\(\\omega\\) is derivative of angle \\(\\theta\\) in 2D. #rkr-e2 $$ \\omega = \\dot\\theta $$  Take \\( \\hat{a} \\) to be a unit vector rotating in the 2D \\( \\hat\\imath\u00e2\u0080\u0093\\hat\\jmath \\) plane, making an angle of \\(\\theta\\) with the \\(x\\)-axis, as in Figure #rkr-f2. Then: $$ \\hat{a} = \\cos\\theta \\,\\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath. $$ Differentiating this expression gives: $$ \\dot{\\hat{a}} = -\\sin\\theta \\, \\dot\\theta \\,\\hat\\imath+ \\cos\\theta \\,\\dot\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath. $$ We now consider an angular velocity vector \\(\\vec\\omega\\). Because the rotation is in the \\(\\hat\\imath\\)\u00e2\u0080\u0093\\(\\hat\\jmath\\) plane, the angular velocity vector must be in the \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction. Thus \\( \\vec\\omega = \\omega \\hat{k} \\). Now we can compute the derivative of \\( \\hat{a} \\) using #rkr-ew, giving: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\dot{\\hat{a}} &= \\vec\\omega \\times \\hat{a} \\\\&= \\omega\\hat{k} \\times \\big( \\cos\\theta \\,\\hat\\imath+ \\sin\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath \\big) \\\\&= \\omega \\cos\\theta \\,(\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\imath)+ \\omega \\sin\\theta \\,(\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\jmath) \\\\&= \\omega \\cos\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath+ \\omega \\sin\\theta \\,(-\\hat\\imath) \\\\&= - \\omega \\sin\\theta \\,\\hat\\imath+ \\omega \\cos\\theta \\,\\hat\\jmath.\\end{aligned} $$ Comparing this expression to the earlier one for \\( \\dot{\\hat{a}} \\)we see that \\(\\omega = \\dot\\theta\\). The right-hand rule convention for angular velocities means that counter-clockwise rotations are positive, just like the usual angle direction convention. Did you know? Angular directions have long been considered to have magical or spiritual significance. In Britain the counterclockwise direction was once known as widdershins, and it was considered unlucky to travel around a church in a widdershins direction. Interestingly, right-handed people tend to naturally draw circles in a counterclockwise direction, and clockwise drawing in right-handed children is an early warning sign for the later development of schizophrenia [Blau, 1977].

Rotations and vector \u00e2\u0080\u009cpositions\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fact that vectors don't have positions means that vector rotations are independent of where vectors are drawn, just like for derivatives. animate reset Show: rigid arrangement fixed origins derivatives Rotational motion of vectors which are drawn moving about. Note that the drawn position does not affect the angular velocity $\\omega$ or the derivative vectors. Properties of rotations Rotations are rigid transformations, meaning that they keep constant all vector lengths and all relative vector angles. These facts are reflected in the following results, which all consider two vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) that are rotating with angular velocity \\( \\vec\\omega \\). Derivative of rotating vector is orthogonal. #rkr-e2a $$ \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\vec{a} = 0 $$  Using #rkr-el and the scalar triple product formula #rvi-es gives: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} \\cdot \\dot{\\vec{a}}&= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\big( \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a} \\big) \\\\&= \\vec{\\omega} \\cdot \\big( \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} \\big) \\\\&= 0.\\end{aligned} $$ Angle \\(\\theta\\) between rotating vectors is constant. #rkr-e2b $$ \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\vec{b} \\cdot\\vec{a}}{b a}\\right) = \\text{constant} $$  We first consider the dot product \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\) and show that this is not changing with time. We do this by using the scalar triple product formula #rvi-es to find: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\frac{d}{dt} \\big( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\big)&= \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\cdot \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\dot{\\vec{b}} \\\\&= (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}) \\cdot \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\cdot (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{b}) \\\\&= \\vec{b} \\cdot (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}) + \\vec{b} \\cdot (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{\\omega}) \\\\&= \\vec{b} \\cdot (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}) - \\vec{b} \\cdot (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{a}) \\\\&= 0.\\end{aligned} $$ Now \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\) is constant and the lengths \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constant, so the angle \\(\\theta\\) between the vectors must be constant. Rotating vectors parallel to \\(\\vec\\omega\\) are constant. #rkr-e2c $$ \\dot{\\vec{a}} = 0 \\qquad \\text{if \\(\\vec{a}\\) is rotating and parallel to \\(\\vec\\omega\\)} $$  From #rkr-el we know that the derivative is $$ \\dot{\\vec{a}} = \\vec\\omega \\times \\vec{a}, $$ but the cross product is zero for parallel vectors, so this the derivative is zero.

Then let \\( \\vec{v} = \\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{u} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{b} \\), so \\( \\hat{u}, \\hat{v}, \\hat{b} \\) is a right-handed orthonormal basis. Take \\(\\phi\\) to be the angle between \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\hat{b} \\). Then we do a rotation by \\(\\theta\\) in the \\( \\hat{u}-\\hat{v} \\) plane: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} &= a \\sin\\phi\\,\\hat{u} + a \\cos\\phi \\,\\hat{b} \\\\\\operatorname{Rot}(\\vec{a};\\theta,\\hat{b}) &= a\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi \\,\\hat{u} + a \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi\\,\\hat{v} + a \\cos\\phi \\,\\hat{b}.\\end{aligned} $$ Now we want to convert from the \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v},\\hat{b} \\) basis to write the rotated result in terms of \\( \\vec{a}, \\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a}), \\hat{b} \\). To do this, we need to work out what \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v},\\hat{b} \\)are in terms of these other vectors. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{v} &= \\frac{\\hat{b} \\times\\vec{a}}{\\|\\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a}\\|} =\\frac{\\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a}}{a \\sin\\phi} \\\\\\hat{u} &= \\frac{\\vec{v} \\times\\hat{b}}{\\|\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{b}\\|} =\\frac{\\vec{v} \\times \\hat{b}}{a \\sin\\phi} =\\frac{(\\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a}) \\times \\hat{b}}{a\\sin\\phi} = \\frac{\\hat{b} \\times (\\vec{a} \\times\\hat{b})}{a \\sin\\phi} \\\\&= \\frac{\\vec{a} - (\\hat{b}\\cdot \\vec{a}) \\hat{b}}{a \\sin\\phi} = \\frac{1}{a\\sin\\phi} \\vec{a} - \\frac{\\hat{b} \\cdot\\vec{a}}{a \\sin\\phi} \\hat{b}.\\end{aligned} $$ Substituting these into the rotated vector expression above gives $$ \\begin{aligned}\\operatorname{Rot}(\\vec{a};\\theta,\\hat{b}) &= a\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi \\, \\left( \\frac{1}{a \\sin\\phi}\\vec{a} - \\frac{\\hat{b} \\cdot \\vec{a}}{a\\sin\\phi} \\hat{b} \\right) \\\\& \\qquad + a \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi \\, \\left(\\frac{\\hat{b} \\times \\vec{a}}{a \\sin\\phi} \\right)+ a \\cos\\phi \\,\\hat{b} \\\\ &= \\cos\\theta\\,\\vec{a} - \\cos\\theta \\,(\\hat{b} \\cdot\\vec{a}) \\,\\hat{b} + \\sin\\theta \\,(\\hat{b} \\times\\vec{a}) + a\\cos\\theta \\,\\hat{b} \\\\ &=\\cos\\theta \\,\\vec{a} + (1 - \\cos\\theta) (\\hat{b}\\cdot \\vec{a}) \\,\\hat{b} + \\sin\\theta \\,(\\hat{b}\\times \\vec{a}).\\end{aligned} $$ Angular acceleration In polar coordinates, acceleration consists of both radial and tangential components. The tangential component is directly related to changes in the angular velocity, which introduces the concept of angular acceleration. Angular acceleration, denoted as \\( \\ddot{\\theta} \\) represents the rate of change of angular velocity \\( \\dot{\\theta} \\) with respect to time. It appears as part of the total acceleration in the tangential direction, described by the unit vector \\( \\hat{e}_{\\theta} \\). The full expression for the acceleration in polar coordinates is: $$ \\vec{a} = (\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2) \\hat{e}_r + (r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta}) \\hat{e}_\\theta $$ Here, the first term of the equation represents the radial component, described by the unit \\( \\hat{e}_r \\), and the second term is the angular component, described by the vector unit \\( \\hat{e}_{\\theta} \\). In the radial component, there is a radial (\\( \\ddot{r} \\)) and a centripetal (\\( r\\dot{\\theta}^2 \\)) term. In the angular component, there is an angular (\\( r\\ddot{\\theta} \\)) and a coriolis (\\( 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} \\)) term. Tangential and Normal basis Normal basis Consider a particle moving with position vector \\( \\vec{r} \\) and corresponding velocity \\( \\vec{v} \\) and acceleration \\( \\vec{a} \\). The tangential/normal basis \\( \\hat{e}_t,\\hat{e}_n,\\hat{e}_b \\) is: Tangential/normal basis vectors. #rkt-eb $$ \\begin{aligned}\\hat{e}_t &= \\hat{v}& &\\text{tangential basis vector} \\\\\\hat{e}_n &= \\frac{\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|}= \\frac{\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a},\\vec{v})}{\\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a},\\vec{v})\\|}& &\\text{normal basis vector} \\\\\\hat{e}_b &= \\hat{e}_t \\times \\hat{e}_n& &\\text{binormal basis vector} \\\\\\end{aligned} $$  These equations are definitions of the basis vectors, so the only thing to derive is the alternative formula for \\( \\hat{e}_n \\). Using the definition of \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) above and #rvc-eu, we see that $$ \\dot{\\hat{e}}_t = \\dot{\\hat{v}} = \\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\dot{\\vec{v}}, \\vec{v}) = \\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v}). $$ Normalizing both sides gives the desired expression: $$ \\frac{\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})}{ \\left\\|\\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})\\right\\|} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{v} \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})}{ \\frac{1}{v} \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})\\|} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})}{ \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})\\|}. $$ The tangential basis vector \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) points tangential to the path, the normal basis vector \\( \\hat{e}_n \\) points perpendicular (normal) to the path towards the instantaneous center of curvature, and the binormal basis vector \\( \\hat{e}_b \\) completes the right-handed basis. animate reset show labels Show: position vector velocity acceleration acceleration decomposition center of curvature osculating circle ang. vel. ang. vel. decomposition Tangential/normal basis associated with movement around a curve in 3D. Observe that the velocity \\( \\vec{v} \\) is always in the \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) direction and that the acceleration \\( \\vec{a} \\) always lies in the \\( \\hat{e}_t,\\hat{e}_n \\) plane (the osculating plane). The center of curvature and osculating circle are defined below. Curvature and torsion Curvature and torsion. #rkt-ek To better understand the geometry of the tangential/normal basis, we can use the curvature \\(\\kappa\\) to describe the curving of the path, and the torsion \\(\\tau\\) to describe the rotation of the basis about the path. These quantities are defined by: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\kappa &= \\frac{d\\hat{e}_t}{ds} \\cdot \\hat{e}_n= \\frac{1}{v} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_t \\cdot \\hat{e}_n & &\\text{curvature} \\\\\\rho &= \\frac{1}{\\kappa} & &\\text{radius of curvature} \\\\\\tau &= -\\frac{d\\hat{e}_b}{ds} \\cdot \\hat{e}_n= -\\frac{1}{v} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_b \\cdot \\hat{e}_n & &\\text{torsion} \\\\\\sigma &= \\frac{1}{\\tau} & &\\text{radius of torsion}\\end{aligned} $$  These equations are definitions, so we need only check that the two expressions for each of \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\tau\\) are equivalent. This follows immediately, however, from the chain-rule conversions #rkt-ea between \\(d/ds\\) and \\(d/dt\\). The radius of curvature \\(\\rho\\) is the radius of equivalent circular motion, and the torsion determines the rate of rotation of the osculating plane, as described below in a section below. Basis derivatives and angular velocity As the point \\(P\\) moves along its path, the associated tangential/normal basis rotates with an angular velocity vector \\(\\omega\\) given by: Angular velocity of the tangential/normal basis. #rkt-ew $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{\\omega} &= v\\tau \\,\\hat{e}_t + v \\kappa \\,\\hat{e}_b\\end{aligned} $$  We start by writing the angular velocity in the tangential/normal basis, giving: $$ \\vec{\\omega} = \\omega_t\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\omega_n\\,\\hat{e}_n+ \\omega_b\\,\\hat{e}_b. $$ Now the basis vector derivatives are given by the cross product by \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) from #rkr-ew, so we can evaluate the expressions #rkt-ek for curvature and torsion to give: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\kappa &= \\frac{1}{v} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_t \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= \\frac{1}{v} (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_t) \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= \\frac{1}{v} (\\omega_b\\,\\hat{e}_n - \\omega_n\\,\\hat{e}_b) \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= \\frac{1}{v} \\omega_b\\end{aligned} $$ and $$ \\begin{aligned}\\tau &= -\\frac{1}{v} \\dot{\\hat{e}}_b \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= -\\frac{1}{v} (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_b) \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= -\\frac{1}{v} (\\omega_n\\,\\hat{e}_t - \\omega_t\\,\\hat{e}_n) \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\&= \\frac{1}{v} \\omega_t.\\end{aligned} $$ Rearranging the final expressions in each case gives \\( \\omega_b = v\\kappa \\) and \\( \\omega_t = v\\tau \\). From the definition #rkt-eb of \\( \\hat{e}_n \\), we see that $$ \\begin{aligned}\\hat{e}_n &= \\frac{\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} \\\\\\hat{e}_n \\cdot \\hat{e}_b &= \\frac{1}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_t) \\cdot \\hat{e}_b \\\\0 &= \\frac{1}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} (\\omega_b\\,\\hat{e}_n - \\omega_n\\,\\hat{e}_b) \\cdot \\hat{e}_b \\\\&= - \\frac{1}{\\|\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t\\|} \\omega_n.\\end{aligned} $$ from which we conclude that \\( \\omega_n = 0 \\), giving us all three components of \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\). Knowing the angular velocity vector of the tangential/normal basis allows us to easily compute the time derivatives of each tangential/normal basis vector, as follows: Tangential/normal basis vector derivatives. #rkt-ed $$ \\begin{aligned}\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t &= \\phantom{-v\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_t - } v\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\\\dot{\\hat{e}}_n &= -v\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_t \\phantom{ - v\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_n + } + v\\tau\\,\\hat{e}_b \\\\\\dot{\\hat{e}}_b &=\\phantom{-v\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_t } - v\\tau\\,\\hat{e}_n\\end{aligned} $$  We can use the expression #rkt-ew for \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) together with #rkr-ew to find the basis vector derivatives: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_t= (v\\tau \\,\\hat{e}_t + v \\kappa \\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times \\hat{e}_t= v \\kappa \\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\\\dot{\\hat{e}}_n &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_n= (v\\tau \\,\\hat{e}_t + v \\kappa \\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times \\hat{e}_n= - v \\kappa \\,\\hat{e}_t + v \\tau \\,\\hat{e}_b \\\\\\dot{\\hat{e}}_b &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\hat{e}_b= (v\\tau \\,\\hat{e}_t + v \\kappa \\,\\hat{e}_b) \\times \\hat{e}_b= -v \\tau \\,\\hat{e}_n.\\end{aligned} $$ Notation note The tangential/normal basis is also called the Frenet\u00e2\u0080\u0093Serret frame after Jean Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric Frenet and Joseph Alfred Serret, who discovered it independently around 1850. The equations #rkt-ed for the basis derivatives are often called the Frenet-Serret formulas, typically written in terms of \\(s\\) derivatives: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\frac{d\\hat{e}_t}{ds} &= \\phantom{-\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_t - } \\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_n \\\\\\frac{d\\hat{e}_n}{ds} &= -\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_t \\phantom{ - \\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_n + } + \\tau\\,\\hat{e}_b \\\\\\frac{d\\hat{e}_b}{ds} &=\\phantom{-\\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_t } - \\tau\\,\\hat{e}_n.\\end{aligned} $$ If we divide the angular velocity vector #rkt-ew by \\(v\\) then we obtain the vector $$ \\frac{1}{v} \\vec{\\omega} = \\tau\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\kappa\\,\\hat{e}_b, $$ which is known as the Darboux vector after its discoverer, Jean Gaston Darboux. Normal and Tangential kinematics While the motion of a point \\(P\\) along a path defines the tangential/normal basis, we can also use this basis to express the kinematics of \\(P\\) itself, giving the following expressions for velocity and acceleration. Velocity and acceleration in tangential/normal basis. #rkt-e $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{v} &= \\dot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t \\\\\\vec{a} &= \\ddot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t + \\frac{\\dot{s}^2}{\\rho} \\hat{e}_n\\end{aligned} $$  From the definition #rkt-eb of \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) we see that \\( v\\,\\hat{e}_t = v\\hat{v} = \\vec{v} \\), which is the first equation above. Differentiating this and using \\( v = \\dot{s} \\) from #rkt-es gives $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{v} &= \\dot{s}\\,\\hat{e}_t \\\\\\vec{a} = \\dot{\\vec{v}}&= \\ddot{s}\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\dot{s}\\,\\dot{\\hat{e}}_t \\\\&= \\ddot{s}\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\dot{s}(v \\kappa \\,\\hat{e}_n) \\\\&= \\ddot{s}\\,\\hat{e}_t + \\frac{\\dot{s}^2}{\\rho} \\,\\hat{e}_n,\\end{aligned} $$ where we used the derivative #rkt-ed of \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) in terms of the curvature \\(\\kappa\\), and the definition #rkt-ek of the radius of curvature to give \\( \\kappa = 1/\\rho \\). The above formula shows that the normal acceleration component \\(a_n\\) is determined by the radius of curvature. We can therefore also find the radius of curvature from knowing the normal acceleration: Radius of curvature \\(\\rho\\) for velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) and acceleration \\(\\vec{a}\\) with angle \\(\\theta\\) between them. #rkt-er $$ \\rho = \\frac{v^2}{a_n} = \\frac{v^2}{|a\\sin\\theta|} $$  From #rkt-ev we known that the normal component of the acceleration is given by \\( a_n =\\dot{s}^2/\\rho \\) and from the definition #rkt-es of path length we have \\( \\dot{s} = v \\), so this equation can be rearranged to give \\( \\rho = v^2 / a_n \\). Now because \\( \\vec{a} \\) only has \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) and \\( \\hat{e}_n \\) components, the \\( \\hat{e}_n \\) component is given by $$ \\begin{aligned}a_n &= \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\hat{e}_t)\\| \\\\&= \\|\\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{v})\\| \\\\&= |a \\sin\\theta|,\\end{aligned} $$ where we used the facts that \\( \\vec{e}_t \\) is in the direction of \\( \\vec{v} \\), that \\( \\operatorname{Comp}(\\vec{a},\\vec{v}) \\) does not depend on the magnitude of \\( \\vec{v} \\), and equation #rvv-em for the magnitude of the complementary projection. animate reset show labels Movement: circle var-circle ellipse arc trefoil eight comet pendulum Show: position vector velocity acceleration acceleration decomposition path center of curvature osculating circle angular velocity Origin: \\(O_1\\) \\(O_2\\) Velocity and acceleration in the tangential/normal basis.

Tangent lines and osculating circles Given a point \\(P\\) moving along a complex path, at a given instant of time we can match different components of the point's motion with successively more complex geometric shapes: match geometric object name \\( \\vec{r} \\) point position \\( \\vec{r},\\vec{v} \\) line tangent line \\( \\vec{r},\\vec{v},\\vec{a} \\) circle osculating circle The osculating circle is the instantaneous equivalent circular path. That is, a particle traveling on the osculating circle with the same location \\(P\\), speed \\( \\dot{s} \\), and tangential acceleration \\( \\ddot{s} \\) as our particle would have matching velocity and acceleration vectors. Osculating circle #rkt-eo $$ \\text{center C} = \\vec{r} + \\rho \\hat{e}_n,\\qquad \\text{radius} \\; \\rho,\\qquad \\text{normal} \\; \\hat{e}_b $$  Consider a particle \\(P\\) with position vector \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) moving with velocity \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) and acceleration \\( \\vec{a}_P \\) , and let \\( \\hat{e}_t,\\hat{e}_n,\\hat{e}_b \\)be the associated tangential/normal basis and \\( \\rho_P \\) be the radius of curvature. Set \\( \\dot{s}_P = v_P \\)and \\( \\ddot{s}_P = \\vec{a}_P \\cdot \\hat{e}_t \\) to be the speed and tangential acceleration of \\(P\\). Next define the osculating circle as above with center \\( C = \\vec{r}_P + \\rho_P \\) , radius \\( \\rho_P \\), and normal vector \\( \\hat{e}_b \\). Now take a second particle \\(Q\\) moving on the osculating circle so that its instantaneous position matches \\(P\\) and it has the same speed \\( \\dot{s}_Q = \\dot{s}_P \\) and tangential acceleration \\( \\ddot{s}_Q = \\ddot{s}_P \\). This means that the radius of the circle \\( r_Q \\) for \\(Q\\) is matches the osculating circle radius \\( \\rho_P \\), so \\( r_Q = \\rho_P \\). We want to prove that \\( \\vec{v}_Q = \\vec{v}_P \\) and \\( \\vec{a}_Q = \\vec{a}_P \\). We will use a polar coordinate system for \\(Q\\), centered at \\(C\\) and in the plane with normal vector \\( \\hat{e}_b \\). At the current instant when the particles are at the same position, this means that \\( \\hat{e}_r = -\\hat{e}_n \\) and \\( \\hat{e}_\\theta = \\hat{e}_t \\). Using the circular motion expressions #rke-ec we have that the velocity of \\(Q\\) is: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= v_Q \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\\\ &= \\dot{s}_Q \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\\\ &= \\dot{s}_P \\,\\hat{e}_t = \\vec{v}_P. \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ For a particle moving in a circle like \\(Q\\), the speed is given by \\( \\dot{s}_Q = v_Q = r_Q \\omega_Q \\), and differentiating this gives \\( \\ddot{s}_Q = r_Q \\dot{\\omega}_Q = r_Q \\alpha_Q \\). Using this, the acceleration of \\(Q\\) is: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a}_Q &= -\\frac{v_Q^2}{\\rho_Q} \\,\\hat{e}_r + \\rho_Q \\alpha_Q \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\\\ &= -\\frac{\\dot{s}_Q^2}{\\rho_Q} \\,\\hat{e}_r + \\ddot{s}_Q \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\\\ &= \\frac{\\dot{s}_P^2}{\\rho_P} \\,\\hat{e}_n + \\ddot{s}_Q \\,\\hat{e}_t \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_Q. \\end{aligned} $$ We thus see that points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) have the same instantaneous velocity and acceleration. This also means that the tangential/normal basis computed at this instant for \\(Q\\) will match that of \\(P\\). The osculating circle lies in the \\( \\hat{e}_t,\\hat{e}_n \\) plane, which is thus called the osculating plane. This plane has normal vector \\( \\hat{e}_b \\), and rotates about \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) with a rotation rate determined by the torsion \\(\\tau\\), as we see from the expression #rkt-ed for the derivative of \\( \\hat{e}_b. \\) animate reset show labels Show: position vector velocity acceleration acceleration decomposition tangent line osculating circle Match phase: 0% Tangent lines and osculating circles, showing matching of velocity or velocity and acceleration, respectively. Curvature on curves Given a parametric curve, its curvature can be directly evaluated with: Curvature of parametric curve \\(\\vec{r}(u)\\) in 3D. #rkt-ec $$ \\kappa = \\frac{\\|\\vec{r}' \\times \\vec{r}''\\|}{\\|\\vec{r}'\\|^3} $$  Because the tangential/normal basis vectors #rkt-eb are all normalized, it does not matter how fast the point moves along the line. We can thus evaluate the parametric curve as a function of time, giving \\( \\vec{r}(t) \\). Now: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\|\\vec{r}'' \\times \\vec{r}'\\| &= \\|\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{v}\\| \\\\&= a v \\sin\\theta \\\\&= \\frac{v^3}{\\rho},\\end{aligned} $$ where we used the cross product length formula #rvv-el and equation #rkt-er for the radius of curvature \\( \\rho \\). By definition #rkt-ek the curvature is \\( \\kappa = 1/\\rho \\), so $$ \\begin{aligned}\\|\\vec{r}'' \\times \\vec{r}'\\|&= v^3 \\kappa \\\\\\kappa &= \\frac{\\|\\vec{r}'' \\times \\vec{r}'\\|}{\\|\\vec{r}'\\|^3}.\\end{aligned} $$ While the above formula can be used in 2D by taking the third component to be zero, it can also be written in an explicitly 2D form: Curvature of parametric curve \\(x = x(u)\\), \\(y = y(u)\\) in 2D. #rkt-e2 $$ \\kappa = \\frac{|x''y' - y''x'|}{(x'^2 + y'^2)^{3/2}} $$  This equation is just #rkt-ec written in explicit 2D coordinates. To see this, we first take the position vector \\( \\vec{r}(u) \\) to be $$ \\vec{r}(u) = x(u)\\,\\hat\\imath + y(u)\\,\\hat\\jmath. $$ Now \\( r'(u) = \\sqrt{(x'(u))^2 + (y'(u))^2} \\) and $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{r}'' \\times \\vec{r}'&= (x''\\,\\hat\\imath + y''\\,\\hat\\jmath)\\times (x'\\,\\hat\\imath + y'\\,\\hat\\jmath) \\\\&= (x''y' - y''x')\\,\\hat{k},\\end{aligned} $$ so evaluating #rkt-ec gives the desired expression. We can take this a step further, and obtain an expression for an explicitly defined function. Curvature of an explicitly defined function \\(y = f(x).\\) #rkt-e3 $$ \\kappa = \\frac{|y''(x)|}{(1 + y'(x)^2)^{3/2}} $$  Use equation #rkt\u00e2\u0080\u0091e2 and parametrize the curve using \\(x\\) as the parametrization variable. Namely: $$ \\begin{aligned}x = u, \\quad \\quad y = y(u) = y(x)\\end{aligned} $$ This yields a very elegant expression, as \\( x'(u) = 1 \\) and \\( x''(u) = 0 \\), which lets us arrive at the desired expression #rkt\u00e2\u0080\u0091e3.

But how valid is this assumption? We will consider motion due to: Spinning of the Earth about the North-South axis. Orbit of the Earth about the Sun. Rotation of the Sun around center the Milky Way. Motion of the Milky Way through the universe. As we will see below, some of these velocities are not small. Why is normally valid to assume that we are in an inertial reference frame? Reference material Elementary motions Concepts applied Angular velocity Angular acceleration Periods of rotation The different types of motion have magnitudes roughly given in the following table. These motions are not all in the same direction, and may add to each other or act in opposite or even orthogonal directions.

The first people to have a rough idea of the radius of the Earth and the distance to the Sun were the ancient Greeks. Eratosthenes (276\u00e2\u0080\u0093195 BCE) computed the radius of the Earth to be 40\u00e2\u0080\u0089000 stadia (6800\u00c2\u00a0km) by measuring the difference in Sun angle between Aswan and Alexandria. Aristarchus of Samos (310\u00e2\u0080\u0093230 BCE) obtained the first estimates of the distance to the Sun by using observations of lunar eclipses and solar parallax. While his method was in principle correct, poor observational data meant that his computed Earth-Sun distance was quite inaccurate. Solar and sidereal time We all know that one day is 24 hours long. But the period of the Earth's rotation is not 24 hours! This is because of the difference between solar time and sidereal time. Solar time is the time measured against the Sun, as we normally do. Sidereal time is measured against the stars, which is slightly different. animate reset Schematic of the Earth's rotation about its own axis and about the sun, counting solar days and sidereal days. Here the Earth has just 8 solar days per year for better visualization. As we can see above, the Earth rotates one more sidereal day each year than solar days. This means: $$ \\text{1 solar year} = \\text{365 solar days}= \\text{366 sidereal days} $$ and so: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\text{sidereal day} &= \\frac{365}{366}\\ \\text{solar day} \\\\&= \\frac{365}{366} \\times 24\\ {\\rm h} \\\\&= 23.93{\\rm\\ h} \\\\&= 23{\\rm\\ h}\\ 56{\\rm\\ min}\\end{aligned} $$ The Earth's orbital angular velocity is thus actually \\( \\omega = 360^\\circ / (23.93{\\rm\\ h}) = 15.04^\\circ/\\rm h \\). The relationship between solar and sidereal days can also be computed by considering just a single day, as shown below. Diagram of one solar day and one sidereal day for the Earth, not drawn to scale. The fact that \\( \\omega_{\\rm E} \\) and \\( \\omega_{\\rm S} \\) are in the same direction means that sidereal days are shorter than solar days (this is not a coincidence). Just as for the definition of a day, there is a similar distinction between the synodic lunar month, which is the time between passes of the Moon between the Earth and the Sun, and the sidereal lunar month, which is the orbital period of the Moon in an inertial frame. In common usage, the phrase lunar month refers to the synodic month. Did you know? Just as sidereal days and solar days are different, the exact length of one year depends on how we define it. The sidereal year is the time for the Earth to complete one orbit relative to the fixed stars, and has length 365.256363 solar days. The tropical year is the time for the Earth to return to the same point in the seasons, which varies around a value of about 365.242189 solar days (about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year). These years are different because of the axial precession of the Earth. In common usage the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cyear\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to the tropical year, as the seasons have historically been more important for people than the motion of the stars. Observe that: $$ 365.242 \\approx 365 + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{400} $$ This is why leap years in our Gregorian calendar add an extra day every 4 years, unless the year is a whole century, except every 400 years. If our calendar used sidereal years instead of tropical, the fact that 365.256363 is slightly larger than 365.25 would mean that about every 200 years we would need to have a double leap year, when there would be two extra days (February 30?). While leap years occur because the year is not an exact integer number of days, a similar problem is caused by the fact that the solar day is not exactly 24 \u00c3\u0097 60 \u00c3\u0097 60 seconds. The length of the day actually varies somewhat unpredictably due to tidal friction as well as climactic and geologic events such as glacier formation and mass redistribution in the mantle, both of which change the Earth's moment of inertia. To correct for these variations a leap second is occasionally added, in which the last minute of the day has 61 seconds. Track transition curves For passengers in a car or train, traveling in a straight line at constant speed is the most comfortable motion, as there is no acceleration. Roads or rail lines with only straight lines are rather limiting, however, so we frequently encounter curves, in the most extreme form in large freeway interchanges such as shown below. When designing a freeway interchange, one of the most basic questions just what shape the transition curves between the straight-line roads should have. Other considerations then follow, such as stacking the roads above each other and banking the angle of the roads. The difficultly in designing curves in roads arises from the need to have a smooth ride for the passengers in the vehicles as they traverse the curves at high speed. In particular, we do not want to have sudden changes in acceleration for the passengers.

Reference material Position, velocity, and acceleration Tangential/normal coordinates Circular arcs for transition curves To understand the issues with transition curve design, we will consider a simple oval track with two straight segments joined by curves at both ends. The simplest curve shapes are semi-circles (half-circles), as shown below. animate Car driving at constant speed around a track with straight line segments joined to perfect semi-circle ends. The graph at the bottom shows the acceleration magnitude versus time. Note the sudden jump in acceleration magnitude when the car switches from a straight line to the curve. If we animate the car driving around the track with semi-circle ends, then we see that there is zero acceleration on the straight segments, but on the semi-circular transition curves the acceleration is inwards with magnitude \\( v^2 / \\rho \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the radius of curvature. A passenger would thus feel no acceleration on the straight segments, but then would suddenly feel a large sideways acceleration as the vehicle switches to the semi-circles, which would be very uncomfortable and potentially dangerous. For passenger comfort, we do not want rapid changes in acceleration for transition curves. That is, we want a low value for the derivative of acceleration with respect to time. The derivative of acceleration is known as jerk, defined by \\( \\vec{\\jmath} = \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\) (for vectors) or \\( j = \\dot{a} \\) (for scalars). With perfect semi-circular ends we see that the jerk is mathematically infinite at the transition to the curve, although in reality it would just be a very high value as the vehicle would not transition to the semi-circle instantaneously. Reference material While the terms velocity and acceleration are standard for the 1st and 2nd derivatives of position, the names for higher derivatives are not so well-established. While jerk is often used for the derivative of acceleration (so the 3rd derivative of position), the terms jolt, surge, and lurch are also sometimes encountered for this quantity. The derivative of jerk is sometimes called jounce (so it is the 4th derivative of position). Another suggestion is to refer to the 4th, 5th, and 6th derivatives of position as snap, crackle, and pop, respectively. Jerk and snap have many applications in engineering and science. For example, jerk and snap have both been used to measure human movement smoothness and diagnose stroke patients (Rohrer et al., 2002) while minimizing snap is often used as a design principle for quadcopter control schemes (Mellinger and Kumar, 2011). Changing accelerations (causing jerk) must result from changing forces, due to Newton's second law. Although the terminology is also somewhat loose in this case, the derivative of force with respect to time is often referred to as yank, and the derivative of yank is called tug (the second derivative of force). Third derivatives and higher of force are very rarely encountered, and do not seem to have any names in common usage. References D. Mellinger and V.

Smooth transition curves with Euler spirals Unlike the sudden switch shown above from a straight line segment (no curvature) to a curved transition curve, we would prefer to have a more gradual transition. An example of this is shown below with the right-hand transition curves changed to use Euler spiral segments, which start curving gradually and then increase the curvature the further the vehicle moves around the curve, before reversing the process on the second half of the curve. Euler spirals are one of the common types of track transition curves and are special because the curvature varies linearly along the curve. animate Car driving at constant speed around a track with perfect straight line segments joined to Euler-spiral segments on the right-hand curve and a semi-circle on the left-hand curve. The red curve is a perfect semi-circle for comparison. Note the continuous transition in acceleration when the car switches from a straight line to the left-hand curve. If we animate the motion around the track with Euler spiral transitions, then we can see from the acceleration magnitude plot that the acceleration does not suddenly jump as the vehicle moves around the right-hand curve. Instead it steadily increases to a maximum value, before decreasing again to zero. The peak acceleration needed on the Euler spiral transitions is somewhat higher than on the semi-circle transitions, but we have avoided the sudden jerk associated with switching from straight line to circular motion. Reference material The equation for a spiral with linear curvature variation was first derived by the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler in 1744, hence the name Euler spiral for this curve. The spiral was then independently rediscovered in the late 1800s by civil engineers who were unaware of Euler's work and who named the resulting spiral the clothoid, which is still a commonly used name in traffic engineering. This spiral also arises in the study of near-field diffraction in optics, as developed by the French engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel and the French physicist Alfred Cornu, for which reason the spiral is also sometimes called the Cornu spiral. Euler spiral equation An Euler spiral is a curve for which the acceleration magnitude increases at a constant rate as we travel along the curve at uniform velocity. Another way to say this is that the curvature is a linear function of the distance along the curve. To see that this is the same thing, we write the acceleration in a tangential/normal basis as For $$ \\vec{a} = \\ddot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t + \\kappa v^2 \\, \\hat{e}_n. $$ constant-speed motion with speed \\(v\\), the distance along the curve satisfies \\( \\dot{s} = v = \\text{constant} \\), so \\( \\ddot{s} = 0 \\). The acceleration vector thus only has a normal component, and this has magnitude proportional to the curvature \\( \\kappa = 1/\\rho \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the radius of curvature. To have the acceleration increasing linearly along the curve, we thus want the curvature to be a linear function of distance, so \\( \\kappa = \\alpha s \\) for some constant \\( \\alpha \\). While specifying that \\( \\kappa = \\alpha s \\) is enough to define the shape of the Euler spiral curve, finding the explicit equation for the curve is not so easy. We first introduce the functions \\(C(z)\\) and \\(S(z)\\), known as Fresnel integrals and defined by: Fresnel integrals #avt-ef $$ \\begin{aligned}C(z) &= \\int_0^z \\cos\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) du \\\\S(z) &= \\int_0^z \\sin\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) du\\end{aligned} $$ The Fresnel integrals do not have any simpler forms in terms of elementary functions, as the integrals in them cannot be computed in closed form. Now we define the constant \\( \\ell = \\sqrt{\\pi/\\alpha} \\), and then the position at distance \\(s\\) along an Euler spiral curve is: Euler spiral #avt-ee $$ \\vec{r} = \\ell C(s / \\ell) \\, \\hat{\\imath}+ \\ell S(s / \\ell) \\, \\hat{\\jmath} $$  We start the spiral curve from the origin, initially moving horizontally to the right and curving upwards with constant speed \\(v\\). Using a tangential/normal basis, let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle of \\( \\hat{e}_t \\) as shown. Then \\( \\dot{\\theta} \\) can be found by considering two expressions for the acceleration. First, from the tangential/normal acceleration formula, we have $$ \\vec{a} = \\ddot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t + \\kappa v^2 \\, \\hat{e}_n = \\alpha s v^2 \\, \\hat{e}_n, $$ where we used the fact that \\( \\ddot{s} = \\dot{v} = 0 \\) (constant speed) and that \\( \\kappa = \\alpha s \\) for some constant \\(\\alpha\\) (the definition of the Euler spiral is that curvature is a linear function of distance \\(s\\)). The second expression for acceleration uses the angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{k} \\) of the tangential/normal basis vectors. Recalling that \\( \\vec{v} = v \\, \\hat{e}_t \\) and \\(v\\) is constant, we have $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} = \\dot{\\vec{v}} = v \\, \\dot{\\hat{e}}_t = v \\, \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{e}_t = v \\dot{\\theta} \\, \\hat{e}_n. \\end{aligned} $$ Comparing the two expressions for \\( \\vec{a} \\) and using \\( s = vt \\) we see that $$ \\dot{\\theta} = \\alpha s v = \\alpha v^2 t $$ and we can integrate this (with the initial condition that $\\(\\theta\\) starts at zero) to give $$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha v^2 t^2. $$ To find the equation for \\( \\vec{r} \\) we can integrate the equation $$ \\dot{\\vec{r}} = v \\, \\hat{e}_t = v \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{\\imath} + v \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{\\jmath} $$ starting from \\( \\vec{r}=0 \\) to obtain $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r} &= \\int_0^t \\left(v \\cos\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha v^2 \\tau^2\\Big) \\, \\hat{\\imath} + v \\sin\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha v^2 \\tau^2 \\Big) \\, \\hat{\\jmath}\\right) d\\tau \\\\ &= \\ell \\int_0^{s/\\ell} \\left( \\cos\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) \\, \\hat{\\imath} + \\sin\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) \\, \\hat{\\jmath} \\right) du, \\end{aligned} $$ where we made the substitution \\( \\tau = \\ell u / v \\) with \\( \\ell = \\sqrt{\\pi/\\alpha} \\). Using the definitions of the Fresnel integrals now gives the desired expression. Plotting the Euler spiral equation gives the curve below, which starts out at the origin with zero curvature, and the then has steadily increasing curvature as we move along it. Euler spiral shape defined by the equation above. Changing the value of \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\ell\\) simply scales the whole curve to make it bigger or smaller, without changing the shape. The full Euler spiral is unsuitable for track transitions, as the curvature increases without limit. Instead, we can piece together short segments of the Euler spiral to form our transition curve. For example, the right-hand curve in the smooth track above is composed of two copies of the first quarter-turn of the Euler spiral, with one copy flipped upside down. This means the curvature starts at zero, increases linearly to a maximum halfway around the curve, then decreases linearly again back to zero to join the straight segment.",

They are: Newton's equations: $$ \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} $$ There is no derivation for Newton's equations, because they are an assumed model for dynamics. We can only verify them by comparing with experimental evidence, which confirms that Newtonian dynamics are accurate for non-relativistic and non-quantum systems. animate reset A point mass moving in the plane with an applied force. You can try to made the mass move in a circle and then see what happens when the force is suddenly removed, which will demonstrate Newton's first law (no net force implies motion at constant speed in a constant direction). Also observe which force directions cause the speed to increase or decrease. Click and drag to impart a force on the particle. Did you know? If we have objects which are either very massive, very small, or moving very fast, then Newton's equations do not provide a good model of their motion. Instead we must use Einstein's equations of general relativity (for massive and fast objects) or the equations of quantum mechanics (for very small objects). Unfortunately, these two theories cannot be used together, so we currently have no good models for objects which are simultaneously very small and very massive, such as micro black holes or the universe shortly after the big bang. Physicists are currently trying to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics by devising a new set of equations (sometimes called quantum gravity or a theory of everything). Current possibilities for new equations include string theory and loop quantum gravity, but none of these are generally accepted yet. It is important to remember that all of these different equations are only models of reality and are not actually real: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll models are wrong. Some models are useful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 George Box Method of assumed forces and method of assumed motion Newton's equations can be used in two main ways. Either we know the forces and we use this to compute the acceleration of a mass, or we know the acceleration and use this to compute the forces. $$ \\begin{align}\\textbf{Method of assumed forces: } \\text{Know } \\vec{F} \\Longrightarrow \\text{Compute } \\vec{a} \\\\ \\textbf{Method of assumed motion: } \\text{Know } \\vec{a} \\Longrightarrow \\text{Compute } \\vec{F} \\end{align} $$ Of course there are other possibilities from these two, such as knowing the vertical component of the force and the horizontal component of acceleration, and then computing the missing components of each. + Example Problem: Method of assumed forces #rep-xf A cannonball of mass \\( m \\) is fired from the origin with initial velocity \\( \\vec{v}_0 \\) and then experiences a force \\( \\vec{F}_{\\rm g} = -m g \\hat{\\jmath} \\) due to gravity and a wind force \\( \\vec{F}_{\\rm w} = -C_{\\rm w} \\hat{\\imath} \\).

Gravity \\( g \\) acts vertically and assume no air resistance.  We can determine the acceleration of the car, and then use Newton's equations and method of assumed motion to find the total force and thus the road force. First, we find the acceleration: $$ \\begin{aligned} x(t) &= x_0 + v_0 t \\\\ \\vec{r}(t) &= x(t)\\,\\hat{\\imath} + y(x(t)) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= (x_0 + v_0 t)\\,\\hat{\\imath} + A \\sin(k x_0 + k v_0 t)\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ \\vec{a}(t) = \\ddot{\\vec{r}}(t) &= - A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x_0 + k v_0 t)\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= - A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\jmath}. \\end{aligned} $$ Given the force of gravity \\( \\vec{F}_{\\rm g} = - m g \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\) and the road force \\( \\vec{F}_{\\rm r} \\), Newton's equations give the forces as: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{F}_{\\rm r} + \\vec{F}_{\\rm g} &= m \\vec{a} \\\\ \\vec{F}_{\\rm r} &= - m A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\jmath} + m g \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= m \\Big(g - A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x)\\Big) \\,\\hat{\\jmath}, \\end{aligned} $$ where we have solved for the road force on the car. Solution steps The steps involved in analyzing a mechanical system with Newton's equations are as follows. $$ \\begin{aligned} &\\text{1. FBD: draw a Free Body Diagram.} \\\\ &\\text{2.

What is the equation of motion for \\( \\ddot\\theta \\) and the tension \\( T \\) in the rod?  It is helpful in this problem to use both Cartesian and polar bases: show bases 1. FBD: The free body diagram for the point mass is: The forces on the free body diagram are: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{F}_g &= - mg \\,\\hat\\jmath \\\\ \\vec{F}_T &= - T \\,\\hat{e}_r. \\end{aligned} $$ 2.

We will convert to \\( \\hat{e}_r,\\hat{e}_\\theta \\) using: $$ \\hat\\jmath = -\\cos\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_r + \\sin\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta, $$ which gives: $$ (-T + mg\\cos\\theta)\\,\\hat{e}_r - mg\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{e}_\\theta = -m\\ell \\dot\\theta^2 \\,\\hat{e}_r + m\\ell\\ddot\\theta \\,\\hat{e}_\\theta. $$ Equating the \\( \\hat{e}_\\theta \\) and \\( \\hat{e}_r \\) terms gives \\( \\ddot\\theta \\) and \\( T \\) by: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\ddot\\theta &= - \\frac{g}{\\ell} \\sin\\theta \\\\ T &= mg\\cos\\theta + m\\ell\\dot\\theta^2. \\end{aligned} $$ A free-body diagram (abbreviated as FBD, also called force diagram) is a diagram used to show the magnitude and direction of all applied forces, moments, and reaction and constraint forces acting on a body. They are important and necessary in solving complex problems in mechanics. What is and is not included in a free-body diagram is important. Every free-body diagram should have the following: The body represented as a dot if it is a point mass, and the body itself if it is a rigid body. The external forces/moments. The force vector should indicate: relative magnitude, point of application, and the direction. A properly defined coordinate system A free-body diagram should not include the following: Bodies other than the body we are interested in. Forces applied by the body Internal forces depending on the chosen system. For example, a free-body diagram on a truss should not include the forces between individual truss members. Kinematic quantities (velocity and acceleration). Warning! Always assume the direction of forces/moments to be positive according to the appropriate coordinate system. The calculations from Newton/Euler equations will provide you with the correct direction of those forces/moments. Things that should not follow this are: Gravity Tension Friction if the velocity \\( \\vec{v} \\) is provided Warning! If forces/moments are present, always begin with a free-body diagram. Do not write down equations before drawing the FBD as those are often simple kinematic equations, or Newton/Euler equations. Numerical integration Independent variable (time).

Applications Accelerating and braking What happens when we step on the gas or brake in a car? The car pushes against the road to either accelerate (gas pedal) or decelerate (brake pedal). But how are the forces on the car and wheels distributed? What determines whether the wheels grip the road or lose traction and spin or slide? To study this problem we need a model. Let's start with the simplest model and then gradually consider more complex models. The classic American Pony Car: a 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. Image source: flikr image by Nick Ares (CC BY-SA 2.0) (full-sized image). The simplest model of a car is to treat the entire vehicle as a point mass. On a free body diagram we have vertical force balance for a stationary car. When the car accelerates, there is a horizontal forward force on the car, and a corresponding backwards horizontal force on the ground. As the car picks up speed, air resistance produces a backwards force. On the diagram we have drawn some forces offset from the center of mass, so that the vectors don't overlap. Because we are assuming a point mass model, however, all vectors are really acting at the same point. While cruising at a constant speed, there is a balance between the horizontal driving force and the drag force due to air resistance. When the car brakes, there is a backwards force that slows the car down to a stop. accelerate brake free body diagram components animation We can think of the force vectors (such as the ground force on the car) as either in separate horizontal and vertical components or as unified vectors. It may be helpful to pause the animation during acceleration and braking to consider the forces at work.

Video of braking in which the rear wheels lose contact. Another burnout video, taken to the point of destruction. Banked turns Turning in a circle requires a vehicle to have a centripetal acceleration inwards on the turn, and so there must be some centripetal force that produces this acceleration. For a vehicle driving on flat ground, this force must be produced by a sideways friction force on the tires. This introduces two problems: If the coefficient of friction is not high enough (say the road is wet or icy), then the friction force will be insufficient and the vehicle will slide off the road. Even if the friction force is high enough, because it acts at the bottom of the tires, it produces a net moment about the center of mass, which can cause the vehicle to roll over. To avoid both of these problems, the road can be banked inwards, so that the outer edge of the road is higher than the inner edge. This is called superelevation and means that some of the centripetal force can be provided by the normal force with the road, reducing the friction force and minimizing the risk of slip or roll. The figure below shows a bus driving around a sharp corner at high speed on a heavily banked road. To understand the dynamics of this vehicle and the design tradeoffs for cornering on banked turns, we need a model. We will start below with a simple point mass model, which will be enough to understand friction and sliding, and then move on to a 2D rigid-body body to understand roll behavior. Setra S 411 HD coach from the TopClass 400 series on the Mercedes-Benz Untert\u00c3\u00bcrkheim test track. This 10.16 m long coach model is relatively compact and has short overhangs, allowing it to traverse the sharp banked corner at about 100 km/h.

Video taken from inside a car driving around the Untert\u00c3\u00bcrkheim track. Track geometry To understand the dynamics of the bus above, we first need a simple model of the geometry of the road. A satellite photo of the track is shown below. The bus was photographed while on the far-left-hand curve, which we can see is approximately a half-circle with radius about 50 m. Satellite image of the Mercedes-Benz test track at Untert\u00c3\u00bcrkheim, on the Neckar River just outside of Stuttgart, Germany. The picture of the bus above was taken on the far-left-hand corner, which has a radius of curvature of about 50 m. Integrated with the test track is the excellent Mercedes-Benz Museum. To make a simple model, let us consider a track with straight segments and half-circular ends, as shown below. If we animate the bus then we can see the vectors for velocity, acceleration, and force as the bus drives around the track. We assume constant speed, so there is only an acceleration when the velocity changes direction around the corners. This model assumes semi-circular track ends, but this is not a good idea in practice. animate show vectors The centripetal acceleration must be caused by an inwards force while going around the corners. To understand the magnitude and source of this force, we now consider a simple point mass model. Did you know? The modern automobile was invented in 1885 by Karl Benz in Mannheim, Germany, about 100 km from Stuttgart. The commercial success of the new invention was significantly aided by Benz' wife Bertha, who marketed the automobile by making the world's first road trip, inventing brake linings in the process. Driven by the post-WWI German economic crisis and hyperinflation, the Benz company later merged with Daimler to form Daimler-Benz, and began producing Mercedes-Benz cars in Untert\u00c3\u00bcrkheim, just outside of Stuttgart, where it is still headquartered. One of the company's engineers, Ferdinand Porsche, later founded his own company, which is also still based in Stuttgart. Point mass model Consider the bus as a single point mass on the track while going around the corner. The diagram below shows the bus front-on, so the inside of the track is towards the left. We start by assuming there is no bank on the road and that the bus is stationary. The free body diagram shows that the gravity force \\(W\\) is balanced by the normal force \\(N\\) from the road. If we now increase the bank angle \\(\\theta\\) below, then we see that a friction force \\(F\\) tangential to the road is needed to keep the bus from sliding. In practice, this force will be limited by \\(F \\le \\mu N\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the coefficient of friction. If we incline the track until it is nearly vertical, we see that there a huge friction force would be required but only a tiny normal force is available. As this would not be possible without gluing the tires to the road, this situation would result in the bus sliding downwards towards the center of the track. free body diagram components Road bank angle: \\(\\theta = \\; \\) 45\\(^\\circ\\) Bus speed: \\(v = \\; \\) 30 \\(\\rm m/s\\) Now set the bank angle back to \\(0^\\circ\\) and make sure the speed is zero and that the free body diagram is visible. Now increase the speed of the bus to produce a centripetal acceleration. Newton's law implies that there must be a centripetal friction force producing this acceleration. As the speed increases, we will eventually reach a point when the friction force required is too large and the bus will slide outwards on the track. To avoid sliding outwards, we can increase the bank on the road. This increases the normal force and decreases the friction force, making it less likely that sliding will occur. For any given speed, there is some angle that exactly cancels the friction force, so that all the force is normal force. This is a very safe driving situation, as no sliding is possible, even in very slippery road conditions. On the real track, the bank angle increases as the bus drives higher. This allows the driver to select the correct incline angle to minimize sliding risk. We can also show the forces in components or as total vectors as we change the bank angle and bus speed. While this simple point mass model allows us to understand how banking the road can help with the problem of sliding, it does not tell us anything about rolling of the vehicle, because point masses can't rotate. We thus need a rigid body model to investigate roll. Did you know? Higher speed and a smaller radius of curvature on a circular track requires higher bank angles, as in the photo below.

Image credit: Daimler Global Media Site (full-sized image, original rotated image). 2D Rigid body model We now use a single rigid body model for the bus and we will do everything in 2D. Below we see a front-on diagram of the bus, with the inside of the track to the left. If we turn on the free body diagram, then we see that the weight of the bus is supported by two forces, one on each wheel. If we increase \\(\\theta\\) then the weight is supported more by the down-slope wheel, and we also see sideways friction forces appear to stop the bus from sliding. If the slope becomes too steep, then the normal force on the up-slope wheel reverses direction, indicating that it is holding the wheel down onto the road. Physically this cannot happen, so at this point the bus would tip over. We needed this rigid-body model to understand this tipping behavior, as we couldn't model this with the point mass model. Depending on the value of the friction coefficient, the bus may either slide or roll first as \\(\\theta\\) increases. free body diagram components Road bank angle: \\(\\theta = \\; \\) 45\\(^\\circ\\) Bus speed: \\(v = \\; \\) 30 \\(\\rm m/s\\) If we now set the bank angle \\(\\theta\\) back to zero, we can start to increase the speed \\(v\\). Now we see that the wheel on the inside of the track takes less of the weight, and the friction forces now stop the bus from sliding outwards on the track. If the bus goes too fast then it will roll outwards on the track (assuming the friction coefficient is high enough that it didn't slide first). Having considered both a banked road with stationary bus, and a moving bus on a horizontal road, we can now combine them to see the advantage of having a banked road when the bus is cornering. Choose a bus velocity, and then change the bank angle \\(\\theta\\), so that the friction force is reduced (helping to avoid sliding) and the normal forces on the wheels are more evenly balanced (helping to avoid rolling). For any given speed, we can choose a bank angle so that there is simultaneously no sideways friction force and also exactly balanced normal forces. This is the safest bank angle for this speed. Design of roads, tracks, and rail A straight road generally has the center somewhat higher than the edges to allow water to run off. This is called cross slope or camber. When it is desired to have a banked turn, then the outer edge of the road is raised to produce superelevation, with the outer edge rising above both the center and the inner edge. The bank angle is chosen based on the radius of curvature of the turn and the expected speed of cars going around the turn, while still allowing for the fact that cars might be moving slowly or even stopped. The angle should thus not be chosen to eliminate all friction forces when cars are traveling at maximum speed, as this would be dangerous if traffic had to stop on the road. Velodromes are arenas with tracks designed for high-speed bicycle races, as shown below, with speeds up to 85 km/h. The bank angle on velodrome tracks is chosen to minimize sideways forces on the bicycles when they are traveling at near maximum speeds, so the angle chosen depends on the radius of curvature of the track corners. For example, the Blaine velodrome track pictured below is 250 m long and has a 43\u00b0 bank angle on the corners and 15\u00b0 banking on the straightaways. Bicycle riders on a banked turn at the Blaine velodrome, part of the National Sports Center in Blaine, Minnesota. Image source: flikr user flyinfoto (CC BY 2.0) (full-sized image). High-speed trains such as the French TGV operate at speeds of over 300 km/h and have run at up to 575 km/h. To accommodate cornering at such speeds, track bends are constructed with a large radius of curvature (at least 7 km for new tracks) and a bank angle of up to about 7\u00b0 (180 mm maximum superelevation with Standard gauge of 1435 mm). For railways, banking the track is know as cant. An alternative approach for cornering with trains is to leave the track relatively flat and to tilt the train as it travels around a corner. This allows high-speed trains to operate on regular tracks, while maintaining safety and comfort for the passengers. For example, the Queensland Rail Tilt Train operates at 180 km/h by tilting at up to 5\u00b0 around corners. As we see from our rigid body analysis above, tilting the train will help with avoiding tipping over at high speeds, but will not help with reducing horizontal friction forces. Even with a tilting train, entering a curve at too high a speed will lead to disastrous results. Did you know? The Blaine velodrome in Minnesota was designed by the famous Schuermann velodrome architects and built from the extremely durable African Afzelia hardwood. Velodrome races are always counter-clockwise and use special bikes with fixed chains (no freewheeling, no gears) and no brakes. The corners are scarily steep: Image credit: Tom McGoldrick (full sized image). Did you know? High-speed trains such as the French TGV and German ICE require many sophisticated engineering techniques to enable travel at extreme speed. Very smooth rails are needed, so the track is formed by welding the segments together into one precisely-aligned continuous steel line. The steel rails conduct heat too well for conventional welding, so thermite welding is used to join the track segments. At high speeds the train drivers are unable to see railway signals on the side of the track. Electronic signaling systems are used to communicate to the drivers, either through the tracks for the TGV or via additional cables for the ICE. Friction-based brakes produce too much heat, as they would need to absorb the kinetic energy of several hundred tonnes of train moving at over 300 km/h. Instead, dynamic breaking is used, in which the electric motors powering the trains are run in reverse as generators and the energy is shed as heat in resistor arrays. At extremely high speeds, the wheels themselves cannot provide sufficient traction to enable braking, so technologies like magnetic induction brakes are being developed, which directly push against the rails without involving the wheels at all. Bus model The bus model used above is a Setra S 411 HD coach. The mass of the vehicle is 12.6 t and the dimensions are shown below. $$ \\begin{aligned} h_1 &= {0.87\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_1 &= {0.30\\rm\\ m} \\\\ h_2 &= {2.24\\rm\\ m} & \\ell_2 &= {0.97\\rm\\ m} \\\\ & & \\ell_3 &= {0.97\\rm\\ m} \\\\ & & \\ell_4 &= {0.30\\rm\\ m} \\end{aligned} $$ Projectiles with air resistance Consider a spherical object, such as a baseball, moving through the air. The motion of an object though a fluid is one of the most complex problems in all of science, and it is still not completely understood to this day. One of the reasons this problem is so challenging is that, in general, there are many different forces acting on such objects, including: gravity drag lift thrust buoyancy bulk fluid motion, such as wind inertial forces, such as the centrifugal and Coriolis forces In most introductory physics and dynamics courses, gravity is the only force that is accounted for (this is equivalent to assuming that the motion takes place in a vacuum). Here we will consider realistic and accurate models of air resistance that are used to model the motion of projectiles like baseballs. Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois is the home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. In baseball, an \u00e2\u0080\u009cout of the park\u00e2\u0080\u009d home run is scored when the ball is hit beyond the green outfield (past the yellow foul pole at the left of the above image). Image source: Flickr image by Mike Bash (CC BY NC ND 2.0) (full-sized image). Drag forces and drag coefficients The drag force is always directly opposed to the velocity of the object. In vector notation, $$ \\vec{F}_{\\rm D} = -F_{\\rm D} \\hat{v}, $$ where \\( F_{\\rm D} \\) is the magnitude of the drag force, and \\( \\hat{v} \\) is the unit vector in the direction of the object's velocity. Velocity angle from horizontal: \\(\\theta = \\; \\) 30\\(^\\circ\\) The free body diagram for a baseball subject to gravity and air resistance. Observe that the drag due to air resistance is always in the opposite direction to the velocity. Image credit: Microsoft clip art. The magnitude of the drag force is characterized by the dimensionless drag coefficient \\( C_{\\rm D} \\), given by $$ C_{\\rm D} = \\frac{F_{\\rm D}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^2}, $$ where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the fluid (in this case, air), \\( A=(1/4)\\pi D^{2} \\) is the cross-sectional area of the object, and \\( v \\) is the object's speed. Drag coefficients as a function of Reynolds number A dimensionless parameter that is very useful in fluid dynamics is the Reynolds number, which is defined as $$ {\\rm Re} = \\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}, $$ where \\( L \\) is a characteristic length for the flow (in this case, the diameter \\( D \\) of the ball), and \\( \\mu \\) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. The Reynolds number gives a ratio between inertial forces and viscous forces in a fluid flow. For very small Reynolds numbers, the viscous forces are much stronger than the inertial forces (think of trying to stir a cup of honey). For very large Reynolds numbers, the viscous forces are negligible, and we refer to the flow as inviscid (think of stirring a cup of coffee). An important result in fluid dynamics is that the drag coefficient is a function only of the Reynolds number of the fluid flow about the object. That is, $$ C_{\\rm D} = C_{\\rm D}({\\rm Re}). $$ This functional relationship has no closed form. However, the relationship has been established numerically based on experimental data. See Figure #aft-fd for a schematic diagram of the drag coefficient's dependence on the Reynolds number. Experimental dependence of drag coefficient on Reynolds number for a sphere. Image credit: NASA via Wikipedia. Quadratic drag model Notice from Figure #aft-fd that there is a range of Reynolds numbers (\\( 10^3 < {\\rm Re} < 10^5 \\)), characteristic of macroscopic projectiles, for which the drag coefficient is approximately constant at about 1/2 (see the part of the curve labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009c4\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Figure #aft-fd). That the drag coefficient is constant means that, within this region, the magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the square of the object\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speed. Substituting \\( C_{\\rm D}=1/2 \\) into the definition of \\( C_{D} \\) above, we obtain $$ F_{\\rm D} = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho A v^2 = c v^2, $$ where we have defined the quadratic drag parameter \\(c\\) as $$ c = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho A = \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\rho D^2, $$ which is a constant for a given projectile. This is referred to as quadratic drag, because the drag force magnitude is proportional to the square of the speed. Using this result, we can write the drag force vector as $$ \\vec{F}_{\\rm D} = - c v^2 \\hat{v}. $$ In the presence of gravity and quadratic drag alone, the net force on an object is given by $$ \\sum \\vec{F} = m \\vec{g} - c v^2 \\hat{v}, $$ where \\( m \\) is the mass of the object and \\( \\vec{g} \\) is the local acceleration due to gravity. Below is an interactive graphic showing the trajectory of an object with gravity and quadratic drag.

Despite this, these are very useful models for mechanics and dynamics. Rotating rigid bodies All points on a rigid body have the same angular rotation angles, as we can see on the figure below. Because the angular velocity is the derivative of the rotation angles, this means that every point on a rigid body has the same angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\), and also the same angular acceleration \\( \\vec{\\alpha} \\). In 2D the angle \\( \\theta \\) of a rigid body the angle of rotation from a fixed reference (typically the \\( \\hat\\imath \\) direction), measured positive counter-clockwise. The angular velocity is \\( \\omega = \\dot\\theta \\) and the angular acceleration is \\( \\alpha = \\dot\\omega = \\ddot\\theta \\).

If P and Q are points on a rigid body, we do not write \\( \\omega_P \\) or \\( \\omega_Q \\) for the angular velocity about these points. Instead, we label angular quantities according to the body. If we have two rigid bodies \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\), then \\( \\omega_1 \\) is the angular velocity of the first body (and all points on it) and \\( \\omega_2 \\) is the angular velocity of the second body. Did you know? Rotations in 3D are significantly more complicated than rotations in 2D. Unlike positions, velocities, etc, which simply go from 2D vectors to 3D vectors, rotational quantities go from scalars in 2D to full 3D vectors in 3D. Angular velocity and angular acceleration are somewhat straightforward, so equations #rkg-er hold in both 2D and 3D, but understanding the rotations themselves is significantly more complicated. There are three main ways that 3D rotations can be represented: Euler angles Rotation matrices Quaternions Detailed study of rotations in 3D is necessary for a full understanding of topics ranging from satellite attitude control to articulated robot construction, and is usually covered in advanced dynamics courses. Points on rigid bodies If we know how one point \\(P\\) on a rigid body is moving and we also know how the body is rotating, then we can calculate the movement of any other point \\(Q\\) on the same body. The formulas for this are given below. Rigid body point relations. #rkg-er $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{r}_Q &= \\vec{r}_P + \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\\\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P+ \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\\\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P+ \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}+ \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ})\\end{aligned} $$ Points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are two locations on a rigid body. Vectors \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) and \\( \\vec{\\alpha} \\) are the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the rigid body.  The first equation is simply the definition of the offset vector \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\). Differentiating the first equation gives $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_Q &= \\vec{r}_P + \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ \\dot{\\vec{r}}_Q &= \\dot{\\vec{r}}_P + \\dot{\\vec{r}}_{PQ} \\\\ \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}, \\end{aligned} $$ where the derivative of \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) comes from the rotation formula, given that this offset vector is simply rotating with the rigid body. If we differentiate again then we obtain $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ \\dot{\\vec{v}}_Q &= \\dot{\\vec{v}}_P + \\dot{\\vec{\\omega}} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\dot{\\vec{r}}_{PQ} \\\\ \\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P + \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}), \\end{aligned} $$ where we use the fact that \\( \\vec{\\alpha} = \\dot{\\vec{\\omega}} \\). + Warning: Cross product order #rkg-wc Because cross products are not associative, it is very important to compute the centripetal acceleration term with the parentheses as shown. That is, we must not compute \\( (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{\\omega}) \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\), as this is always zero. The term \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\) in the acceleration equation above is called the centripetal (center-seeking) term, as it is always in the direction \\( -\\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) and so acts from \\(Q\\) towards the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccenter\u00e2\u0080\u009d \\(P\\). Show: none position velocity acceleration Two points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) on a moving and accelerating rigid body. + Example Problem: Points on a rigid body #rkg-xp A rectangular block is sliding along the ground so that the contact point \\(P\\) is moving at a constant speed of \\(3\\rm\\ m/s\\) to the left. The block is rotating clockwise and just before point \\(Q\\) hits the ground the angular velocity is \\(2\\rm\\ rad/s\\) clockwise and the angular acceleration is \\(3\\rm\\ rad/s^2\\) clockwise. What is the velocity and acceleration of \\(Q\\) just before impact?  Using the regular \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) basis, the known information just before impact is $$ \\vec{r}_{PQ} = 2\\,\\hat\\imath \\qquad \\vec{v}_P = -3\\,\\hat\\imath \\qquad \\vec{a}_P = 0 \\qquad \\vec\\omega = -2\\,\\hat{k} \\qquad \\vec\\alpha = -3\\,\\hat{k}. $$ The velocity and acceleration of \\(Q\\) are given by $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= -3\\,\\hat\\imath - 2\\,\\hat{k} \\times 2\\,\\hat\\imath \\\\ &= -3\\,\\hat\\imath - 4\\,\\hat\\jmath \\\\ \\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P + \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\\\ &= 0 - 3\\,\\hat{k} \\times 2\\,\\hat\\imath - 2\\,\\hat{k} \\times (-2\\,\\hat{k} \\times 2\\,\\hat\\imath) \\\\ &= -6\\,\\hat\\jmath - 2\\,\\hat{k} \\times (-4\\,\\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= -8\\,\\hat\\imath - 6\\,\\hat\\jmath. \\end{aligned} $$ + Example Problem: Coupled rigid bodies #rkg-xc Three rigid bodies (two rods and a block) are coupled by pins at \\(O\\), \\(P\\), and \\(Q\\) as shown. Body \\( \\mathcal{B}_3 \\) cannot rotate and must slide horizontally along the ground. The rod lengths are \\( OP = 3\\sqrt{2}\\rm\\ m \\) and \\( PQ = 5\\rm\\ m \\), and points \\(O\\) and \\(Q\\) are the same height above the ground. At the instant shown, \\( \\theta_1 = 45^\\circ \\), \\( \\omega_1 = 4\\rm\\ rad/s \\) . What are \\( \\omega_2 \\) and \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) at this instant?  Taking a regular \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) basis at \\(O\\), we can use the rod lengths and angles to find the relative position vectors: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r}_{OP} &= 3\\hat\\imath + 3\\hat\\jmath\\rm\\ m \\\\ \\vec{r}_{PQ} &= 4\\hat\\imath - 3\\hat\\jmath\\rm\\ m. \\end{aligned} $$ Using the vector angular velocities \\( \\vec{\\omega}_1 = \\omega_1\\,\\hat{k} \\) and \\( \\vec{\\omega}_2 = \\omega_2\\,\\hat{k} \\), we can now use #rkg-er to find first \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) and then \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) in terms of the unknown angular velocity \\(\\omega_2\\): $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_{P} &= \\vec{v}_O + \\vec{\\omega}_1 \\times \\vec{r}_{OP} \\\\ &= 4\\hat{k} \\times (3\\hat\\imath + 3\\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= -12\\hat\\imath + 12\\hat\\jmath{\\rm\\ m/s} \\\\ \\vec{v}_{Q} &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega}_2 \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= (-12\\hat\\imath + 12\\hat\\jmath{\\rm\\ m/s}) + \\omega_2\\,\\hat{k} \\times (4\\hat\\imath - 3\\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= (-12 + 3\\omega_2)\\,\\hat\\imath + (12 + 4\\omega_2)\\,\\hat\\jmath{\\rm\\ m/s}. \\end{aligned} $$ The last piece of information that we need to use is the constraint on the motion of \\( \\mathcal{B}_3 \\), namely that it can only slide horizontally. This can be expressed by saying that the vertical component of \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) is zero, or more generally that the component in the normal direction \\( \\hat{e}_n = \\hat\\jmath \\) is zero. That is: $$ \\begin{aligned} 0 &= \\vec{v}_Q \\cdot \\hat{e}_n \\\\ &= \\Big((-12 + 3\\omega_2)\\,\\hat\\imath + (12 + 4\\omega_2)\\,\\hat\\jmath\\Big) \\cdot \\hat\\jmath \\\\ &= 12 + 4\\omega_2 \\\\ \\omega_2 &= -3{\\rm\\ rad/s}. \\end{aligned} $$ Substituting this back into the expression above for \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) gives: $$ \\vec{v}_Q = -21\\hat\\imath{\\rm\\ m/s}, $$ which does indeed have no vertical component, as expected. + Warning: Rigid body points may be accelerating even if \\(\\vec{a}_P = 0\\) and \\(\\alpha = 0\\). #rkg-wa If \\( \\vec{\\alpha} = 0 \\) and \\( \\vec{a}_P = 0 \\) for a rigid body then we would normally say that the body itself is not accelerating. This does not mean, however, that the points on the bodies are not accelerating. If the body is rotating (so \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\ne 0 \\)) then the centripetal acceleration means that in fact most points on the body are accelerating at any time. Rigid bodies in 2D The #rkg-er equations above are valid in both 2D and 3D. If we know that we are in the 2D \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane then the angular velocity vector is orthogonal to the plane in the \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction and the equations can be written in a simpler form with the perpendicular vector notation #rvv-en, as shown below. Rigid body point relations in 2D. #rkg-e2 $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{r}_Q &= \\vec{r}_P + \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\\\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P+ \\omega_z \\, \\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp \\\\\\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P+ \\alpha_z \\, \\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp- \\omega^2 \\, \\vec{r}_{PQ}\\end{aligned} $$ Points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are two locations on a rigid body. Scalars \\( \\omega_z \\) and \\( \\alpha_z \\) are the scalar angular velocity and angular acceleration of the rigid body (positive counter-clockwise).  The position vectors \\( \\vec{r}_P \\) and \\( \\vec{r}_Q \\) lie in the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane, so \\( \\vec{v}_P \\), \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\), and \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) are also in this plane. The angular velocity and angular acceleration vectors are orthogonal and thus can be written: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{\\omega} &= \\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\\\ \\vec{\\alpha} &= \\alpha\\,\\hat{k}. \\end{aligned} $$ Evaluating #rkg-er and using the cross-product expression #rvv-e9 now gives the velocity expression: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= \\vec{v}_P + \\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= \\vec{v}_P + \\omega \\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp, \\end{aligned} $$ and the acceleration equation: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a}_Q &= \\vec{a}_P + \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_P + \\alpha\\,\\hat{k} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} + \\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\times (\\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_P + \\alpha\\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp + \\omega\\,\\hat{k} \\times (\\omega\\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp) \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_P + \\alpha\\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp + \\omega^2 (\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp)^\\perp \\\\ &= \\vec{a}_P + \\alpha\\,\\vec{r}_{PQ}^\\perp - \\omega^2 \\vec{r}_{PQ}, \\end{aligned} $$ where we used the fact that \\( \\vec{r}^{\\perp\\perp} = -\\vec{r} \\) (two \\( 90^\\circ \\) rotations make a \\( 180^\\circ \\) rotation). If a point \\(M\\) on a rigid body has zero velocity then it is called the instantaneous center of rotation, because the velocity of all points on the body will be given by simple rotation about \\(M\\) with the angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) of the body. In 2D we can always find the instantaneous center with the following equation, although it might be outside of the physical body. Instantaneous center of rotation \\(M\\) in 2D. #rkg-ei $$ \\vec{r}_{PM} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^2} \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}_P = \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\vec{v}_P^\\perp $$ Point \\(P\\) has velocity \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) and is attached to a rigid body rotating with angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\).  The instantaneous center \\(M\\) has the property that the point on the rigid body at \\(M\\) has zero velocity. We thus want: $$ 0 = \\vec{v}_M = \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PM}. $$ Taking another cross product by \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} 0 &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\Big( \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PM} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}_P + \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PM}) \\\\ &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}_P - \\omega^2 \\, \\vec{r}_{PM} \\text{ (because \\vec\\omega \\perp \\vec{r}_{PM})} \\\\ \\vec{r}_{PM} &= \\frac{1}{\\omega^2} \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}_P. \\end{aligned} $$ Here we used the fact that if \\( \\vec{r}_{PM} \\). lies in the \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane and \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) is in the \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction, then from #rvv-e9 we have \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PM}) = \\omega^2 \\,\\vec{r}_{PM}^{\\perp\\perp} = -\\omega^2\\,\\vec{r}_{PM} \\), as in the derivation of #rkg-e2. In 3D there will only be an instantaneous center if \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) is orthogonal to \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\), in which case there will many choices for the instantaneous center, all lying on a line in the \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\) direction. If \\(M\\) is an instantaneous center, so it has zero velocity, then the velocity of any other point on the rigid body is given by the following equation. Velocity from the instantaneous center \\(M\\). #rkg-ev $$ \\vec{v}_{Q} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{MQ} $$ Point \\(M\\) is the instantaneous center of rotation for a rigid body rotating with angular velocity \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\), and \\(Q\\) is any point on the body.  By definition the instantaneous center has \\( \\vec{v}_M = 0 \\) , so the velocity formula #rkg-er gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_M + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{MQ} \\\\ &= \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{MQ}. \\end{aligned} $$ animation reset show labels Movement: translation var. translation rotation var. rotation slide hinge circle spin reverse spin oscillation Point \\(P\\) \\(P\\) velocity \\(P\\) acceleration \\(P\\) path ang. vel. about \\(P\\) ang. acc. about \\(P\\) \\(P\\) at corner Body \\(Q\\) path ang. vel. ang. acc. inst. cent. \\(M\\) \\(Q\\) Velocity none \\( \\vec{v}_P \\) (trans.) \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) (rot.) \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) (total) all points \\(Q\\) Acceleration none \\( \\vec{a}_P \\) (trans.) \\( \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\) (ang.) \\( \\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ}) \\) (cent.) \\( \\vec{a}_Q \\) (total) all points Velocity and acceleration of points on a rigid body undergoing different motions. Constrained motion One of the most common type of motion is constrained motion, where an object is restricted to move in a certain way. Generally, a point constrained to move in a specific direction obeys the following equation: Constraint equation for a point \\(P\\). #rkc-pc $$ \\vec{v}_P \\cdot \\hat{n}_P = 0 $$ where \\( \\hat{n}_P \\) is the normal vector to the motion of point \\(P\\). The above equation is difficult to apply to a system with a collection of points or particles. It is not the only way to derive constraint equations. For example, rigid body kinematics equations (also known as relative motion equations) are derived using the definition of a rigid body. Namely, the distance and angles between all points remain constant. See rigid body relations. It is often best to look at examples of constrained motion to see how constraint equations are differentiated to obtain velocity and acceleration. We can visualize the motion of several constrained systems, shown on the figure below. animation reset show labels show velocity System: rod-circular slider-crank rod-circular Trace \\(Q\\) slider-crank Trace \\(B\\) \\(B\\) path \\( \\hat{v}_C = \\hat{\\jmath} \\) + Example Problem: Sliding rod #rkc-xcl A uniform rod leaning against a wall has a fixed length of \\(\\ell = 10 \\rm\\ m\\). The bottom of the rod at point \\(P\\) is \\(8 \\rm\\ m\\) from the wall. Point \\(P\\) is moving away from the wall at a speed of \\(6 \\rm\\ m/s\\). The rod maintains contact with the wall and ground at all times. What is \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) of point \\(Q\\), the point at the top of the rod?  To solve this, note the question states that the rod's length is fixed, and is not permitted to lose contact with the wall and ground. Therefore, the constraint equation is given by the Pythagorean theorem: $$ \\begin{aligned} x_P^2 + y_Q^2 = \\ell^2 \\end{aligned} $$ This becomes a related rates problem from calculus 1. Differentiating with respect to time, keeping in mind the chain rule: $$ \\begin{aligned} 2x_P\\dot{x}_P + 2y_Q\\dot{y}_Q = 0 \\end{aligned} $$ The quantity we're interested in is \\( \\dot{y}_Q \\) , or \\( v_Q \\), and \\( y_Q = \\sqrt{\\ell^2 - x_P^2} \\) . Solving yields \\( \\vec{v}_Q = -8\\hat{\\jmath} \\rm\\ m/s \\) . Another way to solve this is using the rigid body relations, knowing that the distance and angles from the top to the bottom of the rod remains constant, which is a rigid body by definition. Using rigid body relations: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_Q &= \\vec{v}_P + \\vec\\omega \\times \\vec{r}_{PQ} \\\\ &= \\vec{v}_P + \\omega_z \\vec{r}_{PQ}^{\\perp} \\end{aligned} $$ where we have two unknowns:\\( \\vec{v}_Q \\) , and \\(\\vec\\omega\\), and \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ} = -\\ell \\cos\\theta \\hat{\\imath} + \\ell \\sin\\theta \\hat{\\jmath} \\rm\\ m \\), where \\( \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x_P}{\\ell}\\right) \\). Therefore, \\( \\vec{r}_{PQ}^{\\perp} = -\\ell \\sin\\theta \\hat{\\imath} - \\ell \\cos\\theta \\hat{\\jmath} \\rm\\ m \\) . Expanding the vector equation into its two scalar equations yields: $$ \\begin{aligned} v_{Qx} &= v_{Px} - \\omega_z \\ell \\sin\\theta \\\\ v_{Qy} &= v_{Py} - \\omega_z \\ell \\cos\\theta \\end{aligned} $$ Since the top of the rod can only move vertically, \\( v_{Qx} = 0, and \\omega_z = \\frac{v_{Px}}{\\ell \\sin\\theta} \\rm\\ rad/s \\) Since the bottom of the rod can only move horizontally, \\( v_{Py} = 0, and v_{Qy} = -\\omega_z \\ell \\cos\\theta \\rm\\ m/s \\) Plugging in \\(\\omega_z\\) expression: $$ v_{Qy} = -\\frac{v_{Px}}{\\ell \\sin\\theta} \\ell \\cos\\theta = -v_{Px}\\cot\\theta \\rm\\ m/s $$ Plugging in the numbers yields the same result of \\( \\vec{v}_{Q} = -8\\hat{\\jmath} \\rm\\ m/s \\) . Note in the rigid body relations method, we implicitly used the constraint equation for a point. Namely, we know that the top of the rod can only move vertically, so \\( \\vec{v}_Q \\cdot \\hat{n}_Q = 0 \\) , where \\( \\hat{n}_Q = \\hat{\\imath} \\) and \\( \\vec{v}_P \\cdot \\hat{n}_P = 0 \\) , where \\( \\hat{n}_P = \\hat{\\jmath} \\). In general, the steps involved in analyzing systems with constrained motions are as follows: Solution procedure for constrained motion. #rkc-cp $$ \\begin{aligned}&\\text{1.

Differentiate once or twice with respect to time to obtain} \\\\& \\quad \\vec{v} \\quad \\text{and} \\ \\vec{a} \\ \\text{relationships.} \\\\&\\text{3. Solve for the desired quantity.}\\end{aligned} $$ + Example Problem: Compound pulley system #rkc-xcp Consider the compound pulley system shown, consisting of two massless pulleys \\(A, B\\). Pulley \\(A\\) is free to move vertically, and pulley \\(B\\) is fixed to the top. The two pulleys are connected by an inextensible, massless rope. One block of mass \\(m_1\\) is connected to pulley \\(A\\) by a string, and another block of mass \\(m_2\\) is hanging from the rope connecting the two pulleys. Assume the pulleys' radii are negligbile. If \\(m_2\\) moves downwards at a velocity \\(v_2 = 6 \\rm\\ m/s\\) and acceleration \\(a_2 = 2 \\rm\\ m/s^2\\), what are the velocity and acceleration of \\(m_1\\)?  We will begin by underlining important information given in the question. Namely: The rope is inextensible, meaning the total length of the rope remains constant. This is our constraint. The pulleys are massless, meaning we do not need to consider any rotational motion they may exhibit. The pulleys radii' are negligbile, meaning we do not need to consider their radii as a part of the total length of the rope. Using the solution procedure highlighted in #rkc-cp: 1. Write down constraint equation in terms of distances/positions. If the rope's length remains constant, we need to choose a reference line to relate the distances of the masses to that reference line and set it equal to the rope's length. The following figure shows the reference line, as well as the masses' distances from that line. Note that \\(y_1\\) is only extended to pulley \\(A\\). Since the pulleys are massless, they will not rotate, and therefore \\(m_1\\) and pulley \\(A\\) will translate vertically together at the same rate. Now, we can write the total length of the rope in terms of those two distances. The total length of the rope,\\(L\\) will be: $$ 2y_1 + y_2 = L $$ 2. Differentiate once or twice with respect to time to obtain \\( \\vec{v} \\) and \\( \\vec{a} \\) relationships. Now, we can take two derivatives with respect to time to obtain the relationship between the speeds \\( v_1, v_2 \\) , and the accelerations \\( a_1, a_2 \\) . $$ \\begin{aligned} 2v_1 + v_2 &= 0 \\\\ 2a_1 + a_2 &= 0 \\end{aligned} $$ Notice that the length of the rope does not matter ultimately. This makes sense, as the length of the rope is constant, and therefore does not change with time. 3. Solve for the desired quantity. We are interested in both the velocity and acceleration of \\(m_1\\). Solving for \\( \\vec{v}_1 = \\frac{-\\vec{v}_2}{2} = 3\\hat{\\jmath}\\rm\\ m/s \\) and \\( \\vec{a}_1 = \\frac{-\\vec{a}_2}{2} = \\hat{\\jmath}\\rm\\ m/s^2 \\) Reflecting on the result obtained, it makes sense. The distance \\(m_1\\) has to travel up the rope is two times more than the length \\(m_2\\) has to travel. We can also draw a free-body diagram to understand this result further. We will return to this example further down when constraint forces are covered. Reference material Calculus and vectors Rigid bodies Kinetics of point masses Kinetics of rigid bodies Free body diagrams Energy and work Applications Four-bar linkages Constraint forces If an object is constrained to move in a specific direction, by Newton's second law, there must be forces or moments preventing the movement of the object in that direction. Those are called constraint forces. The approach to solving for constraint forces is the same approach to solve for any forces/moments that are not constraint forces. Namely, drawing a free body diagram, and applying Newton's equations. See the solution procedure with Newton's equations. Let's return to our example of the rod leaning against a wall. + Example Problem: Constraint forces on a sliding rod. #rkc-xcf A uniform rod of mass \\(m\\) and length \\(\\ell\\) is leaning against a frictionless wall at an angle \\(\\phi\\) as shown. The rod starts sliding along a frictionless ground under the influence of gravity \\( \\vec{g} \\). What are the expressions of the constraint forces \\( \\vec{F}_P, \\vec{F}_Q \\) that ensure the rod maintains contact with the wall and ground at all times?  We will begin by drawing a free body diagram on the rod. Note that due to the constraint placed on the rod, point \\(P\\) can only slide along the ground and therefore by #rkc-pc, \\( \\vec{F}_P \\) acts vertically. Similarly for point \\(Q\\), \\( \\vec{F}_Q \\) acts horizontally. Applying Newton's second law: $$ \\sum \\vec{F}_{ext} = m\\vec{a}_C $$ Breaking it up into the scalar equations. Note we will use \\( \\ddot{x}_C, \\ddot{y}_C \\) to denote the acceleration of the center of mass \\(C\\) in each direction. $$ \\begin{aligned} F_Q &= m\\ddot{x}_C \\\\ F_P - mg &= m\\ddot{y}_C \\end{aligned} $$ Now we can apply the solution procedure detailed in #rkc-cp to find the acceleration of point \\(C\\). Due to our constraint, the following applies at all times: $$ x_C = \\frac{\\ell}{2}\\sin\\phi \\qquad \\qquad y_C = \\frac{\\ell}{2}\\cos\\phi $$ Differentiating twice, keeping in mind the chain rule: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\ddot{x}_C &= -\\frac{\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\sin\\phi + \\frac{\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\cos\\phi \\\\ \\ddot{y}_C &= -\\frac{\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\cos\\phi - \\frac{\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\sin\\phi \\end{aligned} $$ Plugging into Newton's second law equations and solving for each constraint force yields: $$ \\begin{aligned} F_Q &= -\\frac{m\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\sin\\phi + \\frac{m\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\cos\\phi \\\\ F_P &= -\\frac{m\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\cos\\phi - \\frac{m\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\sin\\phi + mg \\end{aligned} $$ + Example Problem: Instance where rod loses contact with a wall. #rkc-xlc A uniform rod of mass \\(m\\) and length \\(\\ell\\) is leaning against a frictionless wall at rest at an angle \\(\\phi\\) as shown. The rod starts sliding on a frictionless ground under the influence of gravity \\( \\vec{g} \\). At what angle \\(\\theta\\) does the rod lose contact with the wall?  While there is contact with the wall, our constraint still holds. This means our constraint forces expressions from #rkc-cf still hold. We are only interested in the constraint force from the wall on the rod, \\( \\vec{F}_Q \\). at \\( \\theta \\): $$ F_Q = -\\frac{m\\ell\\dot\\theta^2}{2}\\sin\\theta + \\frac{m\\ell\\ddot\\theta}{2}\\cos\\theta $$ If the rod loses contact with the wall, then \\( \\vec{F}_Q = 0 \\). We have two unknowns: the angular velocity \\(\\dot\\theta\\) and the angular acceleration \\(\\ddot\\theta\\). However, we know that \\( \\ddot\\theta = \\frac{d\\dot\\theta}{dt} \\) , so if we obtain an expression for \\( \\dot\\theta \\), then finding \\( \\ddot\\theta \\) is possible. We can use conservation of energy to obtain an expression for \\( \\dot\\theta \\). Using the work-energy theorem: $$ W = \\Delta T + \\Delta V $$ The rod is sliding along frictionless surfaces, so there are no non-conservative forces present, and constraint forces do no work (See work done by a constraint force) Therefore: $$ \\begin{aligned} T_1 + V_1 &= T_2 + V_2 \\\\ 0 + mgh_{C, 1} &= \\frac{1}{2}mv_C^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_{C, \\hat{k}}\\omega^2 + mgh_{C, 2} \\end{aligned} $$ From before: $$ \\begin{aligned} h_{C, 1} = y_{C, 1} = \\ell\\cos\\phi \\qquad h_{C, 2} = y_{C, 2} = \\ell\\cos\\theta \\end{aligned} $$ And the velocity of the center of mass at \\( \\theta \\): $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{v}_C &= \\dot{x}_{C,2}\\hat{\\imath} + \\dot{y}_{C, 2}\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &= \\ell\\dot\\theta\\cos\\theta \\hat{\\imath} - \\ell\\dot\\theta\\sin\\theta \\hat{\\jmath} \\end{aligned} $$ So \\( v_C \\) is simply \\( l\\dot\\theta \\). Plugging into our energy conservation, where \\( I_{C, \\hat{k}} = \\frac{1}{12}m\\ell^2 \\): $$ \\begin{aligned} mg\\ell\\cos\\phi &= \\frac{1}{2}m(\\ell\\dot\\theta)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{12}m\\ell^2 \\right) \\dot\\theta^2 + mg\\ell\\cos\\theta \\\\ mg\\ell\\cos\\phi &= \\frac{1}{2}m\\ell^2 \\dot\\theta^2 + \\frac{1}{24}m\\ell^2 \\dot\\theta^2 + mg\\ell\\cos\\theta \\\\ mg\\ell\\cos\\phi &= \\frac{13}{24}m\\ell^2 \\dot\\theta^2 + mg\\ell\\cos\\theta \\end{aligned} $$ Solving for \\( \\dot\\theta^2 \\) : $$ \\dot\\theta^2 = \\frac{24g}{13\\ell}\\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right) $$ Differentiating to obtain \\( \\ddot\\theta \\) : $$ \\begin{aligned} 2\\dot\\theta\\ddot\\theta &= \\frac{24g}{13\\ell}\\sin\\theta\\dot\\theta \\\\ \\ddot\\theta & = \\frac{12g}{13\\ell}\\sin\\theta \\end{aligned} $$ Plugging our results into \\( F_Q \\) : $$ \\begin{aligned} F_Q &= -\\frac{m\\ell\\frac{24g}{13\\ell}\\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right)}{2}\\sin\\theta + \\frac{m\\ell\\frac{12g}{13\\ell}\\sin\\theta}{2}\\cos\\theta \\\\ &= -\\frac{12}{13}mg\\sin\\theta \\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right) + \\frac{6}{13}mg\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Setting \\( F_Q=0 \\) : $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{12}{13}mg\\sin\\theta \\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right) &= \\frac{6}{13}mg\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\\\ 2\\left(\\cos\\phi - \\cos\\theta\\right) &= \\cos\\theta \\\\ 2\\cos\\phi - 2\\cos\\theta - \\cos\\theta &= 0 \\\\ 2\\cos\\phi - 3\\cos\\theta &= 0 \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Solving for \\( \\theta \\) yields \\( \\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\cos\\phi\\right) \\) , or when the rod has fallen 2/3 of the original height. Note if the rod was unconstrained, the constraint we used still holds until the rod has fallen 2/3 of the original height. We can use rigid body relations to find the velocity of point \\(Q\\) once the rod loses contact with the wall, and it will have both vertical and horizontal components of velocity, as expected. + Example Problem: Tension in a compound pulley system. #rkc-xtp Consider the compound pulley system shown, consisting of two massless pulleys \\(A, B\\). Pulley \\(A\\) is free to move vertically, and pulley \\(B\\) is fixed to the top. The two pulleys are connected by an inextensible, massless rope. One block of mass \\(m_1\\) is connected to pulley \\(A\\) by a string, and another block of mass \\(m_2\\) is hanging from the rope connecting the two pulleys. Assume the pulleys' radii are negligbile, and the rope can only slip. What is the tension \\(T\\) in the rope?  We added one more assumption to the ones made in #rkc-xcp. Namely, the rope can only slip. This simply means that the tension is the same at any point in the rope. We will begin by drawing a free body diagram and applying Newton's second law on three bodies: \\( m_1 \\), \\( m_2 \\) and pulley \\(A\\). We will neglect pulley \\(B\\) as it is fixed to the wall, and the results obtained from it are trivial. The free body diagram on pulley \\(A\\) is as follows: Applying Newton's second law: $$ 2T - T_2 = m_A a_A $$ Since the pulley is massless, that means \\( T_2 = 2T \\) . The free body diagram on \\( m_1 \\) is as follows: Applying Newton's second law: $$ 2T - m_1 g = m_1 a_1 $$ Finally, the free body diagram on \\( m_2 \\) is as follows: Applying Newton's second law: $$ T - m_2 g = m_2 a_2 $$ We have 3 unknowns, 2 equations. We apply our constraint equation from #rkc-xcp to relate the accelerations of \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\): $$ 2a_1 + a_2 = 0 $$ Solving for \\(T\\) from Newton's second law on \\( m_2 \\): $$ T = m_2 a_2 + m_2 g $$ Plugging it into Newton's second law on \\( m_1 \\): $$ 2m_2 a_2 + 2m_2 g - m_1 g = m_1 a_1 $$ Since \\( a_2 = -2a_1 \\) : $$ \\begin{aligned} -4m_2 a_1 + 2m_2 g - m_1g &= m_1 a_1 \\\\ g\\left(2m_2 - m_1 \\right) &= a_1\\left(m_1 + 4m_2\\right) \\end{aligned} $$ Solving for \\( a_1 \\) : $$ a_1 = \\frac{g\\left(2m_2 - m_1 \\right)}{m_1 + 4m_2} $$ Plugging that result into Newton's second law on \\( m_1 \\) and solving for \\(T\\): $$ T = \\frac{m_1\\frac{g\\left(2m_2 - m_1 \\right)}{m_1 + 4m_2} + m_1g}{2} $$ Simplifying a little by multiplying the top and bottom by \\( m_1 + 4m_2 \\) : $$ T = \\frac{m_1g(2m_2 - m_1) + m_1g(m_1 + 4m_2)}{2(m_1 + 4m_2)} $$ We obtain our final result for the tension in the rope \\(T\\): $$ T = \\frac{3m_1m_2g}{m_1 + 4m_2} $$ Gears Larger gear - > slower spin Accelerations - > tangential are equal but centripetal are not Opposite direction Standard sign convention \\( \\omega_{1z} \\) and \\( \\omega_{2z} \\) have opposite signs (the gears rotate in opposite direction) Smaller gears rotate faster + Example: Rotating gears. #rkc-gsc + Example: Rotating gears with chain. #rkc-csc Acceleration in contact (no slip) Applications Steering geometry We are all familiar with the idea that turning the steering wheel in a car rotates the front wheels, causing the car to steer into a turn. But why do we normally steer with the front wheels rather than the rear wheels (or all four wheels, as shown below)? Do both front wheels turn the same amount, or is something more complicated going on?

Reference material Rigid bodies Constrained motion Turning rigid bodies When a rigid body turns in a circle, the four corners of the body all move with different velocities and speeds. If we think of a car as a single rigid body with wheels at the corners, this means the four wheels move with different speeds and also different directions. Car designers can choose different steering arrangements, as shown below, where the steering can be with the front two wheels only (conventional cars), with the rear two wheels only (forklifts), or with all four wheels in some high-performance cars. animation reset Show: labels corner velocities radial lines Turn radius: \\(r = \\; \\) 5m Vehicle offset: \\(d = \\; \\) 0% A car turning in a circle, showing the directions that the wheels must point as the turn radius \\(r\\) and offset \\(d\\) change. Did you know? Forklifts typically have fixed front wheels and steer with the rear wheels. This gives them great control over the position of the front lifting forks, but makes steering harder for the operator. Rear-wheel steering is a type of non-minimum phase control system. The technical definition of minimum phase is somewhat complicated, but for vehicle steering it essentially means that we have to steer the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrong way\u00e2\u0080\u009d. For example, to turn right in a forklift we have to first swing the back out to the left. This makes it very easy to accidentally run into obstacles, and is also unstable at higher speeds.

Sometimes in cars it would be convenient to also steer with the rear or trailing wheels, for example when trying to park in a tight spot. We actually have a mechanism for converting a car to trailing-wheel steering, which is to drive backwards, such as when parallel parking. Ackerman steering geometry In a conventional car, the rear two wheels are fixed to point straight ahead, while the front two wheels must turn at different but matched angles. To achieve the correct front wheel angles, cars typically use a four-bar linkage as shown below. The pins at \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are called kingpins (normally actually ball joints in modern cars), the \\(CD\\) rod is called the tie rod, and the \\(AD\\) and \\(BC\\) rods are called steering arms. By correctly choosing the lengths of the linkage rods, the car steering will automatically produce nearly correctly matched front wheel angles to make a perfect turn with any radius of curvature. animation labels reset Steering pivot offset angle: \\(\\theta = \\; \\) 0\\(^\\circ\\) Adjustable Ackerman steering geometry. The graph shows the radius of curvature for the two front wheels as a function of the rack offset \\(d\\). Did you know? Three wheeled vehicles with two wheels in back and one in front (a delta or tricycle configuration) avoid the need for complicated steering geometry, leading Karl Benz to use this system in the world's first automobile.

Episode 4 of Season 9 of Top Gear featured a segment on the Reliant Robin, a three-wheel car produced in the 1970s in the United Kingdom. This Top Gear episode clearly demonstrates some of the reasons that single-wheel steering systems for cars have not achieved long-lasting commercial success. Three-wheeled cars were rather popular with British manufacturers in the 1960s and 1970s. As well as single-wheel-in-front models like the Reliant Robin, there were also production cars with a single wheel in the back (a tadpole configuration). An example of this is the smallest production car ever made, the Peel 50, shown in another Top Gear episode (Series 10, Episode 3). Knee Joint The human knee joint is a type of biological hinge, which allows movement in only one primary angle. The knee connects the femur (the upper leg bone) to the tibia (the larger of the two lower leg bones). These two bones sit next to each other and are free to rotate about a single axis. A mechanism is needed to keep the two legs bones attached to each other, while still allowing rotation. In the case of the human knee this is achieved with a four-bar linkage consisting of the two bones together with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), as shown below. show linkage animation reset An MRI image of a sagittal section through a human knee joint, showing the ACL and PCL ligaments. Image credit: Wikimedia Commons image (CC BY-SA 2.0). The four-bar model of the knee is only approximate, and neglects many important mechanical features. In particular, the ACL and PCL are not rigid rods, and can only provide tensile forces (they act as mechanical ropes). The compressive force is actually provided by the meniscus that separates the femur and tibia bones. In the simple four-bar knee model shown here, the rigid rods include the effects of both the ligaments and the meniscus. References A. B. Zavatsky and J. J. O'Connor.

No joints in the human body have the rotating bone fully constrained by the enclosing socket bone. Instead, like the knee, they have a partial socket or cylinder and the rotating bone is held in place by ligaments. This type of arrangement is typical for most animals, with one rare exception being the European Badger (Meles Meles). In older badgers, the jaw rotates on an entirely enclosed pivot, as shown below. This means that the badger cannot waggle its jaw side-to-side as humans can, and also means that the badger jaw cannot be dislocated or disconnected without breaking the bone. show jaw pivot Image credit: Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0) (full-sized image). Suspensions with Watt's linkage Apart from being one of the inventors of the steam engine and having an SI unit named after him, James Watt also developed a linkage to produce approximate straight line motion. Watt's linkage consists of two long near-parallel links and a small floating link between them, with the near-linear motion occurring for a coupler point midway along the floating link. This linkage is commonly used in suspension systems, as shown below. show linkage animation reset The rear suspension of a 1998 Ford Ranger EV.

A more complete proof in 3D uses the law of cosines. Start with two vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) with an angle \\( \\theta \\) between them, as shown below. Observe that the angle \\( \\theta \\) between vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) is the difference between the angles \\( \\theta_a \\) and \\( \\theta_b \\) from horizontal. If we use the angle sum formula for cosine, we have $$ \\begin{aligned} a b \\cos\\theta &= a b \\cos(\\theta_b - \\theta_a) \\\\ &= a b (\\cos\\theta_b \\cos\\theta_a + \\sin\\theta_b \\sin\\theta_a) \\end{aligned} $$ We now want to express the sine and cosine of \\( \\theta_a \\) and \\( \\theta_b \\) in terms of the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\). We re-arrange the expression so that we can use the fact that \\( a_1 = a \\cos\\theta_a \\) and \\( a_2 = a \\sin\\theta_a \\), and similarly for \\( \\vec{b} \\). This gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} a b \\cos\\theta &= (a \\cos\\theta_a) (b \\cos\\theta_b) + (a \\sin\\theta_a) (b \\sin\\theta_b) \\\\ &= a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} \\end{aligned} $$ The fact that we can write the dot product in terms of components as well as in terms of lengths and angle is very helpful for calculating the length and angles of vectors from the component representations. Length and angle from dot product. #rvv-el $$ \\begin{aligned} a &= \\sqrt{\\vec{a} \\cdot\\vec{a}} \\\\ \\cos\\theta &= \\frac{\\vec{b}\\cdot \\vec{a}}{b a}\\end{aligned} $$  The angle between \\( \\vec{a} \\) and itself is $\\theta = 0$, so \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a} = a^2 \\cos 0 = a^2 \\), which gives the first equation for the length in terms of the dot product. The second equation is a rearrangement of #rvv-ed. If two vectors have zero dot product \\( \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = 0 \\) then they have an angle of \\( \\theta = 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\rm\\ rad \\) between them and we say that the vectors are perpendicular, orthogonal, or normal to each other. In 2D we can easily find a perpendicular vector by rotating \\( \\vec{a} \\) counterclockwise with the following equation.

In 2D there are two perpendicular directions to a given vector \\( \\vec{a} \\), given by \\( \\vec{a}^\\perp \\) and \\( -\\vec{a}^\\perp \\). In 3D there is are many perpendicular vectors, and there is no simple formula like #rvv-en for 3D. animate reset show components The perpendicular vector \\( \\vec{a}^\\perp \\) is always a \\( +90^\\circ \\) rotation of \\( \\vec{a} \\).

For example, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat\\imath \\times \\hat\\jmath &= (i_2 j_3 - i_3 j_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (i_3 j_1 - i_1 j_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (i_1 j_2 - i_2 j_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= (0 \\times 0 - 0 \\times 1) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (0 \\times 0 - 1 \\times 0) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (1 \\times 1 - 0 \\times 0) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= \\hat{k} \\end{aligned} $$ The other combinations can be computed similarly. + Warning: The cross product is not associative. #rvv-wc The cross product is not associative, meaning that in general $$ \\vec{a} \\times (\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{c}) \\ne (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}) \\times \\vec{c}. $$ For example, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\imath} \\times (\\hat{\\imath} \\times \\hat{\\jmath}) &= \\hat{\\imath} \\times \\hat{k} = - \\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ (\\hat{\\imath} \\times \\hat{\\imath}) \\times \\hat{\\jmath} &= \\vec{0} \\times \\hat{\\jmath} = \\vec{0}. \\end{aligned} $$ This means that we should never write an expression like $$ \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\times \\vec{c} $$ because it is not clear in which order we should perform the cross products. Instead, if we have more than one cross product, we should always use parentheses to indicate the order. Rather than using components, the cross product can be defined by specifying the length and direction of the resulting vector. The direction of \\( \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\) is orthogonal to both \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\), with the direction given by the right-hand rule. The magnitude of the cross product is given by: Cross product length. #rvv-el2 $$ \\| \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\| = a b \\sin\\theta $$  Using Lagrange's identity we can calculate: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\| \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\|^2 &= \\|\\vec{a}\\|^2 \\|\\vec{b}\\|^2 - (\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b})^2 \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 - (a b \\cos\\theta)^2 \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 (1 - \\cos^2\\theta) \\\\ &= a^2 b^2 \\sin^2\\theta. \\end{aligned} $$ Taking the square root of this expression gives the desired cross-product length formula. This second form of the cross product definition can also be related to the area of a parallelogram. The area of a parallelogram is the length of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height, which is also the magnitude of the cross product of the side vectors. A useful special case of the cross product occurs when vector \\( \\vec{a} \\) is in the 2D \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) plane and the other vector is in the orthogonal \\( \\hat{k} \\) direction. In this case the cross product rotates \\( \\vec{a} \\) by \\( 90^\\circ \\) counterclockwise to give the perpendicular vector \\( \\vec{a}^\\perp \\), as follows. Cross product of out-of-plane vector \\( \\hat{k} \\) with 2D vector \\( \\vec{a} = a_1\\,\\hat\\imath + a_2\\,\\hat\\jmath \\). #rvv-e9 $$ \\hat{k} \\times \\vec{a} = \\vec{a}^\\perp $$  Using #rvv-eo we can compute: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{k} \\times \\vec{a} &= \\hat{k} \\times (a_1\\,\\hat\\imath + a_2\\,\\hat\\jmath) \\\\ & a_1 (\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\imath) + a_2 (\\hat{k} \\times \\hat\\jmath) \\\\ &= a_1\\,\\hat\\jmath - a_2\\,\\hat\\imath \\\\ &= \\vec{a}^\\perp. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product identities Cross product anti-symmetry. #rvi-ea $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times\\vec{b} = - \\vec{b} \\times\\vec{a}\\end{aligned} $$  Writing the component expression #rvv-ex gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} &= (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= -(a_3 b_2 - a_2 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\imath} - (a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} - (a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= -\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{a}. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product self-annihilation. #rvi-ez $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} = 0\\end{aligned} $$  From anti-symmetry #rvi-ea we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} &= - \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} \\\\ 2 \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} &= 0 \\\\ \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{a} &= 0. \\end{aligned} $$ Cross product bi-linearity. #rvi-eb2 $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{a} \\times (\\vec{b} + \\vec{c})&= \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c} \\\\(\\vec{a} + \\vec{b}) \\times \\vec{c}&= \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c} + \\vec{b} \\times \\vec{c} \\\\\\vec{a} \\times (\\beta \\vec{b})&= \\beta (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})= (\\beta \\vec{a}) \\times \\vec{b}\\end{aligned} $$  Writing the component expression #rvv-ex for the first equation gives: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times (\\vec{b} + \\vec{c}) &= (a_2 (b_3 + c_3) - a_3 (b_2 + c_2)) \\,\\hat{\\imath} \\\\ &\\quad + (a_3 (b_1 + c_1) - a_1 (b_3 + c_3)) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &\\quad + (a_1 (b_2 + c_2) - a_2 (b_1 + c_1)) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= \\Big((a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\Big) \\\\ &\\quad + \\Big((a_2 c_3 - a_3 c_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 c_1 - a_1 c_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 c_2 - a_2 c_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c}. \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ The second equation follows similarly, and for the third equation we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\vec{a} \\times (\\beta \\vec{b}) &= (a_2 (\\beta b_3) - a_3 (\\beta b_2)) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 (\\beta b_1) - a_1 (\\beta b_3)) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 (\\beta b_2) - a_2 (\\beta b_1)) \\,\\hat{k} \\\\ &= \\beta \\Big( (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) \\,\\hat{\\imath} + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) \\,\\hat{k} \\Big) \\\\ &= \\beta (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}). \\end{aligned} $$ The last part of the third equation can be seen with a similar derivation. Derivatives Time-dependent vectors can be differentiated in exactly the same way that we differentiate scalar functions. For a time-dependent vector \\( \\vec{a}(t) \\), the derivative \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}}(t) \\) is: Vector derivative definition. #rvc-ed $$ \\begin{aligned} \\dot{\\vec{a}}(t)&= \\frac{d}{dt} \\vec{a}(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t\\to 0} \\frac{\\vec{a}(t + \\Delta t) -\\vec{a}(t)}{\\Delta t}\\end{aligned} $$ Note that vector derivatives are a purely geometric concept. They don't rely on any basis or coordinates, but are just defined in terms of the physical actions of adding and scaling vectors. reset labels Increment: \\(\\Delta t = \\) 2 s Show: vector increment \\( \\Delta\\vec{a} \\) approximate derivative \\( \\Delta\\vec{a} / \\Delta t \\) exact derivative \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\) Time: \\(t = \\) 0 s Vector derivatives shown as functions of \\(t\\) and \\(\\Delta t\\).

Alternatively, we can hold \\(\\Delta t\\) fixed and vary \\(t\\) to see how the approximation changes depending on how \\( \\vec{a} \\) is changing. We will use either the dot notation \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}}(t) \\) (also known as Newton notation) or the full derivative notation \\( \\frac{d\\vec{a}(t)}{dt} \\) (also known as Leibniz notation), depending on which is clearer and more convenient. We will often not write the time dependency explicitly, so we might write just \\( \\dot{\\vec{a}} \\) or \\( \\frac{d\\vec{a}}{dt} \\). See below for more details. Newton versus Leibniz Notation Most people know who Isaac Newton is, but perhaps fewer have heard of Gottfried Leibniz. Leibniz was a prolific mathematician and a contemporary of Newton. Both of them claimed to have invented calculus independently of each other, and this became the source of a bitter rivalry between the two of them. Each of them had different notation for derivatives, and both notations are commonly used today. Leibniz notation is meant to be reminiscent of the definition of a derivative. Leibniz notation. #rvc-lbz $$ \\frac{dy}{dt}=\\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t}. $$ Newton notation is meant to be compact. Newton notation. #rvc-new $$ \\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dt}. $$ Note that a superscribed dot always denotes differentiation with respect to time \\(t\\). A superscribed dot is never used to denote differentiation with respect to any other variable, such as \\(x\\). But what about primes? A prime is used to denote differentiation with respect to a function's argument. For example, suppose we have a function \\(f=f(x)\\). Then $$ f'(x) = \\frac{df}{dx}. $$ Suppose we have another function \\(g=g(s)\\). Then $$ g'(s) = \\frac{dg}{ds}. $$ As you can see, while a superscribed dot always denotes differentiation with respect to time \\(t\\), a prime can denote differentiation with respect to any variable; but that variable is always the function's argument. Sometimes, for convenience, we drop the argument altogether. So, if we know that \\(y=y(x)\\), then \\(y'\\) is understood to be the same as \\(y'(x)\\). This is sloppy, but it is very common in practice. Each notation has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of Newton notation is that it is compact: it does not take a lot of effort to write a dot or a prime over a variable. However, the price you pay for convenience is clarity. The main advantage of Leibniz notation is that it is absolutely clear exactly which variable you are differentiating with respect to. Notice how, with Leibniz notation, you can imagine the \\(dx\\)'s \"cancelling out\" on the right-hand side, leaving you with \\(dy/dt\\). Derivatives and vector \"positions\" When thinking about vector derivatives, it is important to remember that vectors don't have positions. Even if a vector is drawn moving about, this is irrelevant for the derivative. Only changes to length and direction are important. animate reset Show: derivative at \\(t = 0\\) \\( \\vec{a}(t) \\) with fixed base derivative at current \\(t\\) Movement: bounce stretch circle twist slider rotate vertical fly Vector derivatives for moving vectors. Vector movement is irrelevant when computing vector derivatives.

If they are, then we need to take this into account as well. reset labels Time: \\(t = \\) 0 s Show: derivative first component second component Basis: \\( \\hat\\imath,\\hat\\jmath \\) \\( \\hat{u},\\hat{v} \\) The vector derivative decomposed into components.

Consider the following examples of the chain rule in the two notations: $$ \\begin{aligned}&\\text{Newton:}&\\dot{y}=y'(x)\\dot{x} \\\\ &\\text{Leibniz:}&\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\frac{dx}{dt}.\\end{aligned} $$ Notice how, with Leibniz notation, you can imagine the \\(dx\\)'s \"cancelling out\" on the right-hand side, leaving you with \\(dy/dt\\).

Chain rule for vectors. $$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\vec{a} (s(t)) = \\frac{d\\vec{a}}{ds}(s(t)) \\frac{ds}{dt}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{a}}{ds} \\dot{s} $$ + Example Problem: Chain rule. #vcc-chr A vector is defined in terms of an angle \\(\\theta\\) by \\( \\vec{r}(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat\\jmath \\). If the angle is given by \\(\\theta(t) = t^3\\), what is \\( \\dot{\\vec{r}} \\)?  We can use the chain rule to compute: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{d}{dt} \\vec{r} &= \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\vec{r} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt} \\theta \\\\ &= \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\Big( \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat\\imath + \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat\\jmath \\Big) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt} (t^3) \\right) \\\\ &= \\left(\\Big( -\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat\\imath + \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat\\jmath \\Big) \\cdot (3 t^2) \\right) \\\\ &= -3 t^2 \\sin(t^3)\\,\\hat\\imath + 3 t^2 \\cos(t^3)\\,\\hat\\jmath \\end{aligned} $$ Alternatively, we can evaluate \\( \\vec{r} \\) as a function of \\(t\\) first and then differentiate it with respect to time, using the scalar chain rule for each component: $$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\vec{r} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\Big( \\cos(t^3)\\,\\hat\\imath + \\sin(t^3)\\,\\hat\\jmath \\Big) \\ = -3 t^2 \\sin(t^3)\\,\\hat\\imath + 3 t^2 \\cos(t^3),\\hat\\jmath $$ Integration Cartesian.

    "text": "Complex Problems  Composite Thermodynamic Systems Before starting any problem, it is very helpful to familiarize yourself with the elements being addressed and any terminology being used. In approaching integrated, multi-device systems, following steps provide a framework that may avoid simple mistakes: Identify known states - states are known in a simple, compressible system when two intensive thermodynamic properties are known. Determine unknowns - stream states, energy flows, and mass flows are all potential unknowns. Write energy balances - the number of unknowns must equal the number of mass and energy balances to solve a system. Step 1: Identify Known States The state principle is a guide to aid in determining the number of independent properties required to fix the state of a system. When the state of a system is known, it can be plotted as a single point on a \\( pv \\) diagram. The state of a simple, compressible substance is considered known if at least two intensive properties are known. Recall that intensive properties are independent of the total mass of the substance, such as \\( v \\), \\( u \\), \\( h \\), \\( T \\), \\( p \\), and \\( x \\). Step 2: Determine Unknowns We next apply our knowledge of thermodynamic devices to identify other energy flows in the system that might not be given. Although the primary purpose of this class is tracking the flow of energy, the preliminary step before writing any energy balance should be to identify mass flow streams and write any mass balances. Step 3: Write Energy Balances After determining the necessary mass rate balances, we can write energy balances. Depending on the amount of unknown, as variables needing to be determined there are two approaches to writing energy balances. Write an energy balance for each device where there is one system boundary around each device. Write an energy rate balance for the entire composite system that includes all devices within the entire composite system. The total possible equations are determined by the sum of the number of `devices` that possess at least one unknown value (energy balances) \\( N_E \\) and the number of `devices` for which mass streams branch (mass balances) \\( N_M \\). $$ \\text{Total independent equations} = N_E + N_M $$ Example: Refrigeration and Heat Pump Cycles Refrigeration and heat pump cycles differ from a power cycle in \\( 3 \\) ways: 1) heat is transferred from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir, going in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, 2) there is a net power input to accomplish this task, and 3) performance is not quantified in terms of thermal efficiency \\( \\eta \\) since this performance measurement does not reflect the objective of these cycles. Performance is still quantified as Performance #performance $$ \\text{Performance} \\equiv \\frac{\\textrm{Required Output}}{\\textrm{Necessary Input}} $$ For a refrigeration cycle, the required output is heat removed from the cold environment and the necessary input is the net work input \\( |\\dot{W}_{\\text{cycle}}| \\). For a heat pump, the required output is the heat transferred to the hot environment. These performance measures are known as the coefficient of performance \\( \\beta \\) and \\( \\gamma \\) for a refrigeration cycle and heat pump cycle, respectively. Refrigeration/heat pump cycle consists of the following types of thermal devices: Throttle: expansion valve Heat exchanger: evaporator and condenser Compressor Figure 1: A schematic of a refrigeration cycle or heat pump cycle. All known properties and energy flows are represented with variables. Refrigerant is the working fluid. Step 1: The streams that have known states are streams 1 and 3. Known energy flow in the cycle is the power input into the compressor, \\( \\dot{W}_c \\). Step 2: The unknowns for this cycle are streams 2 and 4, and heat flow in (\\( Q_\\text{in} \\)) and heat flow out (\\( Q_\\text{out} \\)). Step 3a: The coefficient of performance of the refrigeration cycle, \\( \\beta \\), requires \\( Q_\\text{in} \\). To solve for \\( Q_\\text{in} \\), we can define a combined system of evaporator and expansion valve (streams 1 and 3 are known). The energy balance for the combined evaporator and expansion valve system: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dU}{dt}} &= \\dot{Q} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot{W}} + \\sum \\dot{m}_\\text{in} h_\\text{in} - \\sum \\dot{m}_\\text{out} h_\\text{out} \\\\&= \\dot{Q}_\\text{in} + \\dot{m} (h_\\text{1} - h_\\text{3}) \\\\\\dot{Q}_\\text{in} &= \\dot{m} (h_\\text{3} - h_\\text{1})\\end{aligned} $$ The expression for the coefficient of performance, \\( \\beta \\), as a function of \\( |\\dot{W}_{cycle}| \\), the heat input, and the heat output that corresponds to a refrigeration cycle is therefore: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\beta &= \\frac{\\text{required output}}{\\text{necessary input}} \\\\&= \\frac{\\dot{Q}_\\text{in}}{\\dot{W}_c} \\\\&= \\frac{\\dot{m}(h_3-h_1)}{\\dot{W}_c}\\end{aligned} $$ Step 3b: For a heat pump cycle, the coefficient of performance, \\( \\gamma \\), requires \\( Q_\\text{out} \\). To solve for \\( Q_\\text{out} \\), we can define a combined system of compressor and condenser (streams 3 and 1 are known). The energy balance for the combined compressor and condenser system: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dU}{dt}} &= \\dot{Q} - \\dot{W} + \\sum \\dot{m}_\\text{in} h_\\text{in} - \\sum \\dot{m}_\\text{out} h_\\text{out} \\\\&= - \\dot{Q}_\\text{out} + \\dot{W}_c + \\dot{m} (h_\\text{3} - h_\\text{1}) \\\\\\dot{Q}_\\text{out} &= \\dot{W}_c + \\dot{m} (h_\\text{3} - h_\\text{1})\\end{aligned} $$ The expression for the coefficient of performance \\( \\gamma \\) as a function of \\( |\\dot{W}_{cycle}| \\), the heat input, and the heat output that corresponds to a heat pump cycle is therefore: $$ \\begin{aligned}\\gamma &= \\frac{\\text{required output}}{\\text{necessary input}} \\\\&= \\frac{\\dot{Q}_\\text{out}}{\\dot{W}_c} \\\\&= \\frac{\\dot{W}_c + \\dot{m}(h_3-h_1)}{\\dot{W}_c} \\\\&= 1 + \\frac{\\dot{m}(h_3-h_1)}{\\dot{W}_c}\\end{aligned} $$ Transient Systems A transient system is a system in which the time derivative related to the system gain or loss (such as mass or energy) is not zero, which is the opposite of a steady state system. Transient Systems: Mass Flow $$ {\\frac{dm}{dt}(t)}\\neq 0 $$ Energy Flow $$ {\\frac{dE}{dt}(t)}\\neq 0 $$ Transient vs. Steady State Example Imagine a two-tiered water fountain as depicted below. The maximum mass capacities of tier A and tier B are \\( m_{A,max} \\) and \\( m_{B,max} \\), respectively. Once the mass in the tier crosses its threshold, water will overflow the tier. The inlet mass flow rate is a constant given by \\( \\dot{m}_{in} \\). However, the outlet flow rate is proportional to the amount of material in tier B, written as \\( \\dot{m}_{out} = m_B(t)/\\mathcal{T} \\), where \\( 1/\\mathcal{T} \\) is a proportionality constant with units of inverse time and \\( m_B(t) \\) is the mass of the fluid in tier B at time \\( t \\). We can fully describe the fountain's operation at a variety of time points and conditions using the mass balance expressions. Figure 2: A two-tiered water fountain. Steady-State: Drawing a system boundary, \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\), around the entire fountain and considering when the fountain might be operating in steady-state (The diagonal arrow with the `ss' label indicates that this term is eliminated due to a `steady-state' assumption), Eqn. MassBalanceDiff, simplifies to, $$ \\begin{split}\\cancelto{ss}{\\frac{dm}{dt}(t)} &= \\dot{m}_{in} - \\dot{m}_{out}(t) \\\\0 &= \\dot{m}_{in} - m_B(t)/\\mathcal{T}\\end{split} $$ from which it is clear that the fountain will operate at steady state whenever Steady state mass-balance #SS_mB $$ m_{B} = \\dot{m}_{in}\\mathcal{T}. $$ Figure 3: A block diagram depicting mass flow in the two tier water fountain. Transient System: If it rains, an additional mass flow rate \\( \\dot{m}_{rain} \\) into the fountain must also be considered. Eqn. MassBalanceDiff then becomes $$ 0 = \\dot{m}_{in} + \\dot{m}_{rain}- m_B(t)/\\mathcal{T}, $$ from which we conclude that steady state occurs when \\( m_B= \\mathcal{T}(\\dot{m}_{in}+\\dot{m}_{rain}) \\). The fountain will overflow when the mass of water in Tier B is larger than its maximum allowable volume, or when \\( m_B > m_{B,max} \\). Combining these relations, we determine that the fountain will overflow from rain when $$ \\dot{m}_{rain} > \\frac{m_{B,max}}{\\mathcal{T}} -\\dot{m}_{in}. $$ Similarly, overflow might occur when the timescale \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) is increased, for example due to debris blocking the outlet pipe from Tier B even in the absence of rain. This scenario occurs when $$ \\mathcal{T}> \\frac{m_{B,max}}{\\dot{m}_{in}}. $$ We model the transient process of turning on the fountain from an initially empty state (\\( m_A(0) = m_B(0) = 0 \\)), by first re-drawing our system in a way that clarifies system boundaries and mass flows. First, Tier A will fill. Drawing our system boundary around the Tier A block above (\\( \\mathcal{B}_A \\)) and using Eqn. MassBalanceInt we obtain the following expression for the mass in Tier A, $$ m_A(t) = \\cancel{m_A(0)} + \\int_0^t \\left( \\dot{m}_{in} - 0\\right) d\\tau = m_{in}t. $$ Thus, the mass in Tier A increases linearly with time in proportion to the inlet flow rate. Tier A reaches it's capacity when \\( m_A(t) = m_{A,max} = \\dot{m}_{in}t \\) or at time \\( t_{AB}= m_{A,max}/\\dot{m}_{in} \\). Afterward, Tier A is in steady-state, \\( \\dot{m}_A = \\dot{m}_{in} \\), and flow enters Tier B. Drawing our system boundary around the Tier B block above (\\( \\mathcal{B}_B \\)) and using Eqn. MassBalanceDiff we obtain the following expression for the mass in Tier B for \\( t > t_{AB} \\) as, $$ \\frac{dm_B}{dt}(t) = \\dot{m}_{A} - \\frac{mF_B(t)}{\\mathcal{T}}. $$ It follows that the solution to this first-order, linear differential equation is $$ m_B(t)= \\cancel{m_B(0)}e^{-t\\mathcal{T}} + \\mathcal{T}\\dot{m}_{A} (-e^{-t/\\mathcal{T}})= \\mathcal{T}\\dot{m}_{in} (1-e^{-t\\mathcal{T}}) $$ As \\( t\\rightarrow\\infty \\), the mass \\( m_B(t) \\) asymptotically converges to \\( \\dot{m}_A\\mathcal{T} \\), just as we found in our earlier steady state solution (Eq. SS_mB). These results are summarized in Figure FountainPlot. Figure 4: A plot of the transient response of the water fountain in both tiers assuming that Tier B does not overflow.",

    "text": "Cycles  Much of the power that we use in our daily lives is produced through cycles operating with a working fluid. Carnot cycle A Carnot cycle is defined as an ideal gas, undergoing a 4-step, reversible, closed thermodynamic cycle. Imagine that an ideal gas contained within a piston-cylinder undergoes the series of processes depicted in Fig. CarnotCycle below, with the gas starting in state \\( 1 \\) before progressing to states \\( 2 \\), \\( 3 \\), \\( 4 \\), and then returning to state \\( 1 \\) to complete a cycle. Figure 1: A schematic of a piston-cylinder executing a Carnot cycle between hot and cold thermal reservoirs. During the cycle, the system contacts sequentially a hot reservoir and a cold reservoir at temperatures \\( T_H \\) and \\( T_C \\), respectively. While in contact with a thermal reservoir, the system remains at the temperature of the thermal reservoir. In between reservoir contacts, the system is insulated and no heat transfer occurs. Each process quasi-static, and reversible. In this idealized cycle, heat transfers in and out of the system despite the fact that there is no temperature difference to drive heat flow. Such hypothetical heat flow is reversible because an infinitesimal increase in the reservoir temperature relative to the system will cause heat to flow into the system, or vice versa for an infinitesimal decrease in the reservoir temperature. This idealized cycle is known as a Carnot cycle. Reversible process: In a reversible process, the direction can be reversed at any point by an infinitesimal change in external conditions. Quasi-static process: A process that occurs at an infinitesimally slow rate so that the system is in a thermodynamic equilibrium at all times. Carnot Cycle Steps In processes \\( 2 \\to 3 \\) and \\( 3 \\to 4 \\), work is done by the gas. Figure PVwork1 illustrates two potential, monotonic processes corresponding to positive work, or work done by the gas. On the left, pressure is higher in state \\( b \\) than state \\( a \\). On the right, pressure is higher in state \\( a \\) than state \\( b \\). \\( V_b > V_a \\) in both cases. When illustrating the magnitude of the work to be determined, the arrow is drawn out of the system as shown in state \\( 1 \\). Figure 2: Work done by the gas In processes \\( 1 \\to 2 \\) and \\( 4 \\to 1 \\), work is done on the gas. Figure PVwork1 illustrates two potential, monotonic processes corresponding to positive work, or work done by the gas. On the left, pressure is higher in state \\( b \\) than state \\( a \\). On the right, pressure is higher in state \\( a \\) than state \\( b \\). \\( V_a > V_b \\) in both cases as shown in Figure PVwork2. Recall the expression for \\( pV \\) work, $$ W = \\int_{V_a}^{V_b} p(V) dV, $$ noting that work for these processes is negative as indicated by the right-to-left process curve arrow in each of the \\( pV \\) diagrams. When illustrating the magnitude of the work to be determined, the arrow is drawn into the system as shown in state \\( a \\) (Fig. PVwork2). Figure 3: Work done on the gas To plot the processes that make up the cycle in Fig. CarnotCycle, we first observe that processes \\( 2 \\to 3 \\) and \\( 4 \\to 1 \\) are isothermal, meaning the temperature of the working fluid is constant during the process. Given that the working fluid is an ideal gas, \\( pV = mRT \\) and therefore Pressure in an isothermic process #IG_eos2 $$ p = \\frac{mR}{V} T $$ where \\( m \\) is the mass of gas and \\( R \\) is the gas constant. An isothermal process at \\( T_H \\) or \\( T_C \\), the temperature of the hot and cold reservoirs, must therefore fall on the dashed lines in Fig. CarnotpV. These lines are known as isotherms. Figure 4: \\(pV\\) curves for ideal gas expansion and compression in a Carnot cycle. Processes \\( 1 \\to 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\to 4 \\) are adiabatic, meaning that during the process no heat transfer occurs. We will show later in the class that the adiabatic, reversible expansion or compression of an ideal gas must obey the relation Ideal gas law in an adiabatic process #polytropic $$ pV^{\\gamma}=C $$ where \\( \\gamma \\) and \\( C \\) are constants and \\( \\gamma > 1 \\). Therefore these processes must fall on a curve defined by Ideal gas law in an adiabatic process #Pexpression $$ p(V)=\\frac{C}{V^{\\gamma}}, $$ illustrated for two values of \\( C \\) by the dash-dot lines in Fig. CarnotpV. Combining the \\( p(V) \\) relations for the ideal gas expansion and compression with the directionality of the work shown in Figs. PVwork1 and PVwork2, we can plot a Carnot cycle for an ideal gas on a \\( pV \\) diagram as shown in Fig. CarnotpVcycle. The work done by the cycle \\( W \\) is positive and equal to the shaded area in Fig. CarnotpVcycle, where the net work is described as the sum of the work done during each of the processes, $$ W= W_{12} + W_{23} + W_{34} + W_{41} $$ Figure 5: A \\(pV\\) diagram for an ideal gas undergoing a Carnot cycle as depicted in Fig. CarnotCycle. Isothermal Processes For isothermal processes \\( 2 \\to 3 \\) and \\( 4 \\to 1 \\) the work is determined by the \\( p(V) \\) relation in Eqn. IG_eos2 which yields $$ W_{23} =mRT_H\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_3}{V_2}\\right) \\,\\,\\text{ and }\\,\\, W_{41} = mRT_C\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_4}\\right) $$ Because temperature is not changing and the fluid is an ideal gas, the change in internal energy for these processes is zero. An energy balance on the gas for each of these processes yields $$ Q_{23} = Q_{H} = W_{23} = mRT_H\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_3}{V_2}\\right) $$ where \\( Q_H \\) refers to the heat transferred into the system from the hot reservoir and $$ Q_{41} = - Q_{C} = W_{41} = mRT_C\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_4}\\right) $$ where \\( Q_C \\) refers to the heat transferred from the system to the cold reservoir. Adiabatic Processes For adiabatic, reversible processes \\( 1 \\to 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\to 4 \\) the work is given by $$ W_{12} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{C_{12}}{V^{\\gamma}} dV \\text{ and } W_{34} = \\int_{V_3}^{V_4} \\frac{C_{34}}{V^{\\gamma}} dV $$ which, when integrated yield $$ \\begin{gathered}W_{12} =\\frac{-C_{12}}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{V_2^{\\gamma-1}} - \\frac{1}{V_1^{\\gamma-1}}\\right) \\\\\\text{ and } \\\\ W_{34} = \\frac{-C_{34}}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{V_4^{\\gamma-1}} - \\frac{1}{V_3^{\\gamma-1}}\\right) \\end{gathered} $$ Multiplying both sides of the relation in Eqn. polytropic by \\( 1/V^{\\gamma-1} \\) and using the resulting relation, \\( pV = C/V^{\\gamma-1} \\), combined with the ideal gas equation of state, we can express the work in the adiabatic, reversible processes as $$ W_{12} =\\frac{mR(T_C - T_H)}{\\gamma - 1} \\,\\,\\text{ and }\\,\\, W_{34} = \\frac{mR(T_H - T_C)}{\\gamma - 1} $$ illustrating that the work in these two processes are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. It is interesting to determine the relationship between volume and temperature in the end states of processes \\( 1 \\to 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\to 4 \\) for the ideal gas. For an infinitesimal change in internal energy \\( dU \\) no heat flow occurs, but an infinitesimal amount of \\( pV \\) work is done, \\( \\delta W = p dV \\). We write this infinitesimal form of the energy balance as $$ d U = \\cancelto{0}{\\delta Q} - \\delta W = -p dV $$ For an ideal gas, \\( dU/dT = mc_v \\) and \\( p = mRT/V \\) so that $$ c_v dT = -\\frac{RT}{V} dV $$ Separating the volume \\( V \\) and temperature \\( T \\) and integrating, between states \\( 1 \\) and \\( 2 \\) yields $$ \\int_{T_C}^{T_H} \\frac{c_v}{RT} dT = \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right). $$ Integrating between states \\( 4 \\) and \\( 3 \\) yields $$ \\int_{T_C}^{T_H} \\frac{c_v}{RT} dT = \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_4}{V_3}\\right). $$ The left hand side of both Eqns. VT12 and VT43 are equal so that $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_4}{V_3}\\right). $$ or equivalently\\sidenote \\( \\ln(x/y) = \\ln x - \\ln y \\). $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_4}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_3}\\right). $$ Recalling the results from the energy balances on the isothermal processes (Eqns. QH and QC) we can show that the ratio of the heat influx \\( Q_H \\) to heat loss \\( Q_C \\) is $$ \\frac{Q_H}{Q_C} = \\frac{T_H\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_3}{V_2}\\right) }{T_H\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_4}{V_1}\\right)} $$ Applying Eqn. V1234, which defines the relationship between the states before and after the adiabatic processes, we obtain Heat-temperature relationship #HeatTemp $$ \\frac{Q_H}{Q_C} = \\frac{T_H}{T_C} $$ for an ideal gas undergoing a Carnot cycle. Internal Energy Balance of the System The total change in the internal energy of the Carnot cycle \\( \\Delta U \\) can alternately be determined by an energy balance on the cycle $$ \\begin{aligned}\\Delta U&= Q - W \\label{Ebalance} \\\\&= Q_H - Q_C - W_{12} - \\underbrace{W_{23}}_{=Q_H} - \\underbrace{W_{34}}_{=-W_{12}} - \\underbrace{W_{41}}_{=-Q_C} \\label{Ebaldetailed} \\\\&= 0\\end{aligned} $$ Thus the Carnot cycle is consistent with the energy change for a cycle in general. Thermal Efficiency This Carnot cycle turns heat input \\( Q_H \\) into work output \\( W \\). The thermal efficiency \\( \\eta \\) for such a heat engine is given by Heat engine efficiency $$ \\eta = \\frac{\\text{net work output}}{\\text{heat input}} = \\frac{W}{Q_H} $$ Combining \\( \\Delta U = 0 \\) for a cycle, the expression for the energy balance on the cycle (Eqns. Ebalance and Ebaldetailed), and the temperature-heat transfer relationship found in Eqn. HeatTemp yields Heat engine efficiency in terms of temperature only $$ \\eta = \\frac{Q_H - Q_C}{Q_H} = 1-\\frac{T_C}{T_H}. $$ A Carnot cycle produces the maximum possible efficiency for any heat engine. The efficiency can only approach \\( 1 \\) (equivalent to 100\\%) when either \\( T_C \\to 0 \\) or \\( T_H \\to \\infty \\), neither of which is physically attainable. Figure 6: A schematic of a vapor power plant capable of undergoing a Rankine cycle. Figure 7: A \\(T-s\\) diagram of an ideal Rankine cycle. A Rankine Cycle The Rankine cycle is the basis for steam-electric power plants, which produce nearly 90% of all electricity worldwide. This cycle includes two isentropic processes, and utilizes isobaric heat transfers. An ideal Rankine cycle consists of the following internally reversible processes: Process \\( 1\\to 2 \\) : Isentropic expansion of the working fluid through the turbine from saturated vapor at state \\( 1 \\) to the condenser pressure \\( p_2 \\). Process \\( 2\\to 3 \\) : Heat transfer from the working fluid as it flows at constant pressure \\( p_2 = p_3 \\) through the condenser, exiting as a saturated liquid at state \\( 3 \\). Process \\( 3\\to 4 \\) : Isentropic compression in the pump to state \\( 4 \\) in the compressed liquid region of the phase diagram. Process \\( 4\\to 1 \\) : Heat transfer to the working fluid as it flows at constant pressure \\( p_4 = p_1 \\) through the boiler to complete the cycle. Instead, the condenser stream is taken to the saturated liquid state, so that only a compressed liquid must be pumped.\\sidenote Cavitation is less of an issue in the two phase fluid used in the turbine since the vapor bubbles that form nearer the saturated vapor portion of the vapor dome are less driven to collapse. While state \\( 4 \\) could be taken all the way to \\( T_{\\text{sat}}(p_4 = p_1) \\), this would also lead to practical difficulties since, to maintain an isothermal heat transfer, a large thermal reservoir would be required. Instead, the process from state \\( 4 \\) to state \\( 1 \\) follows an isobar as shown in the plot below. For reversible processes, the second law can be written as: Second law $$ Q = \\int T dS, $$ meaning that the area under the curve in a \\( T \\)-\\( s \\) diagram corresponds to heat transferred to or from a system. Thus to approximate a Carnot cycle, an average temperature value at which the same heat transfer \\( Q_H \\) occurs can be approximated on the diagram. Since the Carnot cycle tells us that the maximum thermal efficiency of a power cycle is: $$ \\eta = 1- Q_C/Q_H = 1-T_C/T_H $$ it is clear from Fig. TsDiagramRankine that a hypothetical Carnot cycle with maximum operating temperature \\( T_H \\) will always have a greater thermal efficiency than a Rankine cycle with the same maximum operating temperature since the average operating temperature of the Rankine cycle is lower. Otto Cycle The Otto cycle provides an approximation of the internal combustion engines that still make up the largest share of the transportation industry. An automotive internal combustion engine uses a reciprocating piston-cylinder action to produce work. In a four-stroke engine The intake valve is open and the piston makes an intake stroke to draw in a fresh charge, e.g., a combustible mixture of fuel and air. The intake valve closes and the piston undergoes a compression stroke that increases the pressure and temperature of the air within. At the end of the compression, combustion is induced, e.g., via a spark plug. A power stroke follows as the gas mixture expands, doing work on the piston. Finally, the exhaust valve is opened and burned gases are purged during an exhaust stroke. The Otto cycle simplifies this process by ignoring affects associated with the addition and removal of fuel. Instead it uses air, acting as an ideal gas, to provide insight into how such cycles can be optimized. The combustion itself is replaced by heat transfer and all processes are internally reversible. As a result, the Otto cycle consists of the following steps. Process 1-2: Isentropic compression of the air as the piston moves from bottom to top. Process 2-3: Constant-volume heat transfer to the air from an external source while the piston is at the top. (Approximates fuel ignition and rapid burning.) Process 3-4: Isentropic expansion (power stroke). Process 4-1: Constant-volume process in which heat is rejected from the air while the piston is at the bottom. Note that because it is operating within a piston cylinder, the states the processes operate between are the state of the air in the closed piston cylinder system. This is different from the Rankine cycle, in which the stream states change by going through processes facilitated by different thermodynamics devices. We will show in class that the thermal efficiency of an Otto cycle can be expressed entirely as a function of the compression ratio, \\( r \\), defined as the ratio of the largest gas volume over the smallest \\( V_1/V_2 \\) according to: Thermal efficiency of an Otto cycle $$ \\eta = 1-\\frac{1}{r^{k-1}} $$ and shows that engine efficiency can be increased by inducing a larger change in piston chamber volume. Of course, further practical considerations, such as the increased weight of such an engine, provide other design constraints. We only touch on a few of these design constraints, but in general thermodynamics provides many of the key principles through which energy systems can be optimized.",

    "text": "Entropy  The Second Law: Energy dispersal All energy spontaneously disperses if it is not prevented from doing so. This fact has been repeatedly deduced from observation and underlies the variety of ways of stating the second law of thermodynamics. Clausius Statement of the Second Law Heat spontaneously flows from a hot object to a colder object, but not the other way around. It is impossible for any system to operate in such a way that the sole result would be an energy transfer by heat from a cooler to a hotter body. Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the Clausius Statement of the Second Law. Expansion A gas trapped in a rigid chamber will fill this container's volume. If this chamber is to expand, the gas will spontaneously expand to fill the entire chamber. Figure 2: Spontaneous expansion of a gas. A closed system energy balance on the chamber illustrates that the gas experiences no energy change, i.e., because no heat transfer occurred and no work was done on or by the system. $$ \\begin{aligned}\\Delta U = U_{\\text{after}} - U_{\\text{before}} &= Q - W \\\\U_{\\text{after}} - U_{\\text{before}} &= 0 \\end{aligned} $$ Though the energy has not changed, the energy has spread out, or dispersed, within the chamber, meaning there aremore ways for the energy to exist in the chamber, or that the gas has more microstates available to it. Directionality Figure 3: Spontaneous lowering of a weight on a pulley. From observations of spontaneous processes, it is suggested that the second law restricts the directionality of processes. Spontaneous processes such as falling objects (Fig. WeightLower) and cooling frying pans are encountered every day. Spontaneous processes are irreversible, meaning that after they occur, the system and all parts of its surroundings cannot be exactly restored to their respective initial states. Auxiliary processes that can return the system to its initial state (i.e., raise the object or heat the pan), also change the state of the surroundings. These experiences suggest a directionality to processes that is formalized by the second law of thermodynamics. Kelvin-Planck Statement of the Second Law Statement: It is impossible for any system to operate in a thermodynamic cycle and deliver a net amount of energy by work to its surroundings while receiving energy by heat transfer from a single thermal reservoir. Any hypothetical system that violates either the first or the second laws of thermodynamics cannot be. Clausius Inequality The Clausius inequality, a collary of the second law, states that for any thermodynamic cycle Clausius inequality #ClausiusIneq $$ \\oint \\left(\\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\right)_b \\leq 0 $$ where \\( \\delta Q \\) is the heat transfer across some part of the system boundary for some portion of the cycle, and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature at that part of the system boundary, of which we are reminded by the subscript `b`. Reversible Process A cycle is reversible when the Clausius inequality becomes equality. In a reversible process, the system and all parts of its surroundings can be exactly restored to their respective initial states after the process has taken place. Such processes cannot occur in reality. Internally Reversible Cycles Internally reversible processes contain no irreversibilities within the system, but can interact with surroundings that include irreversibilities. Thus the validity of the equality holds, even in surroundings where irreversibilities occur. What is Entropy? For a reversible processes, the integral of \\( \\delta Q/T \\) is path independent, and this thermodynamic property is called entropy. $$ S_2 - S_1 = \\left(\\int_1^2 \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\right)_{\\text{int rev}}. $$ Entropy \\( S \\) is the measure of energy dispersal as a function of temperature. Entropy is a state function, with the state being determined by any two intensive thermodynamic properties. An entropy change for an incompressible substance depends only on temperature. Differential form of the closed system energy balance The differential form of the closed system energy balance for an internally reversible process on a simple, compressible system can be written as, Differential form of energy-balance equation #fund $$ du = T ds - pdv $$ Specific Entropy of an Ideal Gas For an ideal gas with a given, constant specific heat \\( c_v \\), its change in specific entropy from a state \\( 1 \\) to a state \\( 2 \\) is given by the expression Change in entropy for ideal gas with constant \\(c_v\\) $$ s_2 - s_1 = c_v\\ln\\frac{T_2}{T_1}+ R \\ln\\frac{v_2}{v_1} $$ where \\( R \\) is the gas constant and \\( v \\) is the specific volume. For an ideal gas with a given, constant specific heat \\( c_p \\), its change in specific entropy is given by the expression. Change in entropy for ideal gas with constant \\(c_p\\) $$ s_2 - s_1 = c_p\\ln\\frac{T_2}{T_1}- R \\ln\\frac{p_2}{p_1}. $$ Differential form of the enthalpy equation This differential equation of enthalpy and Eqn. fund are both known as fundamental equations of thermodynamics and relate thermodynamic properties between states. We use these expressions and the ideal gas as a model substance to gain some physical insight about entropy. Differential form of enthalpy equation $$ dh = Tds + v dp. $$ Entropy Balance The closed system entropy statement of the second law derives from the Clausius Inequality which in turn derives from the Kelvin-Planck statement. As we have shown, this statement is \\(\\color{red} \\textrm{Title?}\\) #Centropy1 $$ S_2 - S_1 = \\left(\\int_1^2 \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\right)_{\\text{b}} +\\sigma $$  $$ \\begin{aligned}\\left(\\int_1^2 \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\right)_{\\text{b}} + \\left(\\int_2^1 \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\right)_{\\text{b}} &\\leq 0 \\\\\\left(\\int_1^2 \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\right)_{\\text{b}} + S_1 - S_2 &= -\\sigma \\\\ \\left(\\int_1^2 \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\right)_{\\text{b}} +\\sigma &= S_2 - S_1 \\end{aligned} $$ where \\( \\sigma \\) represents the entropy produced in the system due to the irreversibilities (Fig. EntropyBal) in the process and the `b' indicates that the heat is transferred across a boundary having temperature \\( T_b \\). To satisfy the second law, \\( \\sigma \\geq 0 \\). Entropy production \\( \\sigma \\) only equals zero when a process is reversible. Entropy Balance and multiple heat transfer events When boundary temperature is constant, and multiple, distinct heat transfers occur, Eqn. Centropy1 becomes Entropy balance equation #EntropyBalance $$ S_2 - S_1 = \\sum_i \\frac{Q_i}{T_{\\text{b},i}} +\\sigma. $$ Rate of Change of Entropy In the absence of mass flow, the rate of change of the entropy in a system is derived as Rate of change of entropy with no mass-flow $$ \\begin{aligned}\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(S - S_0\\right) &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( \\sum_i \\frac{Q_i}{T_{\\text{b},i}} +\\sigma \\right) \\\\ \\frac{dS}{dt} &=\\sum_i \\frac{\\dot{Q}_i}{T_{\\text{b},i}} +\\dot{\\sigma}.\\end{aligned}` $$ Microstates The sets of possible configurations of the molecules are known as microstates and a state has a higher entropy when there are more microstates available to it. When adding mass to a system (as shown via a two-dimensional gas of two particles in a volume, which is then doubled as shown at the top of Fig. Indistinguishable), If the added particles are identical to the original particles (indistinguishable). Therefore, the two `microstates' at the lower left are exactly the same even if the particles switch places, and this counts as only one microstate. On the other hand, for distinguishable particles, the two microstates are different. More microstates means higher entropy, thus when combining dissimilar materials there is a so-called entropy of mixing. (This course does not include entropy of mixing.) The addition of identical substances requires no entropy of mixing and therefore entropy of the new system increases in direct proportion to its increase in mass. Figure 5: An illustration of the effect of distinguishable versus indistinguishable particles on microstates and therefore on system entropy. Principal of Superposition Entropy added to a system thus follows a principal of superposition meaning that the total system entropy, \\( S \\), is the sum of the sub-system entropies. $$ S = \\sum_i m_is_i, $$ where each subsystem `\\( i \\)` of mass \\( m_i \\) has specific entropy \\( s_i \\) relative to some universal reference state. Open System Entropy Rate Balance It follows that for an open system involving no mixing of substances, the entropy rate balance is simply Entropy rate of change balance #EntropyRateBalance $$ \\frac{dS}{dt} =\\sum_i \\frac{\\dot{Q}_i}{T_{\\text{b},i}} + \\sum_{\\text{in}} \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}}s_{\\text{in}} - \\sum_{\\text{out}} \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}}s_{\\text{out}} + \\dot{\\sigma} . $$",

    "text": "Energy Transfers  When mass does not flow into or out of a system, the energy of the system changes in only two ways, through the loss or addition of work and/or heat. The internal energy (\\( U \\)) of a system is affected by the energetic contributions from heat flow (\\( Q \\)) in and out of a system and work (\\( W \\))done by or on a system. Energy balance equation #ebal $$ \\Delta U = Q - W. $$ Figure 1: A schematic illustrating the direction of energy flow when heat is transferred to/from the system and work is performed on or by the system. Heat In thermodynamics, heat \\( Q \\) is the thermal energy transferred between systems due to a temperature difference. Heat can both flow into and out of a system as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: A schematic illustrating the heat flow transferred to/from the system. Work Recall from previous physics courses, that when a force \\( f \\) acts over a distance \\( d \\) it does work, defined as Linear work force-displacement relationship $$ W=fd. $$ However, applied force does not have to be constant during a process. More generally, work is General work force-displacement relationship #genw $$ W=\\int_{d_1}^{d_2}f(x)dx $$ where \\( f \\) varies along the path parameterized by \\( x \\) from position \\( d_1 \\) to position \\( d_2 \\), where we are assuming \\( f \\) is tangent to the path. \\(pV\\) work Work done by or on a gas, is known as \\( \\boldsymbol{pV} \\)~work. A gas, such as the one enclosed in the cylindrical device in Figure 3, applies a force uniformly over an area \\( A \\), due to collisions against the wall, which is defined as pressure, Pressure definition #pdefn $$ p=\\frac{f}{A}. $$ Figure 3: A sub-volume of gas, imparting forces from collisions on a sub-section of the container wall having area, \\(A\\). Referring back to the definition of work in Eqn. GenW, if \\( x \\) is a single cartesian direction normal to an area \\( A \\) then \\( A\\cdot dx \\) is a differential volume \\( dV \\). Additionally, using the definition of pressure Eqn. pdefn, we can define \\( pV \\) work as follows, \\(pV\\) work equation #pvwork $$ \\begin{aligned} W &=\\int_{d_1}^{d_2}f(x)\\,dx \\\\ &=\\int_{d_1}^{d_2}\\frac{f(x)}{A}A,dx \\\\ &=\\int_{V_1}^{V_2}p(V),dV \\end{aligned} $$ \\( pV \\) diagrams Graphs whose \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) axes are \\( p \\) and \\( V \\), respectively. According to the pV work equation, work is the area under the process curve. An example is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: \\(pV\\) diagrams for 2 processes where the start and end state are identical but with differing processes. Isobaric Process: During the process to go from 1 state to another, the system remains at a constant pressure, as shown in Figure 4 (left). Work is path dependent: Work transfer depends on the process. Figure 4 shows two processes where despite having the same initial and final thermodynamic states, the difference in magnitude of work for these two processes is different. Shaft work Work can also be done via shaft work. This can be explained by a shaft, on which a weight and pulley are mounted, providing a mechanism for inputting or extracting work as in Figure 6. Work \\( W_{\\text{cycle}} \\) is done by the lowering mass on the system when the mass is released from its the raised position. The motion of the molecules in the system increases due to the shaft work input. This additional molecular energy temporarily increases the temperature of the system before the excess thermal energy is transmitted as heat \\( Q \\) to the reservoir. Figure 5: Spontaneous lowering of a weight on a pulley. Figure 6: A cycle in contact with a single thermal reservoir (left) may operate such that work input leads to an equal amount of heat output.

    "text": "Substances  Phases of matter A phase of matter is homogeneous in both its molecular composition and the structure of its molecules with respect to one another. Pure Substance: A pure substance is when a substance occurs in a single phase and is composed of a single type of molecule. Solid: A substance that has a definite shape and volume is a solid. The molecules in a solid are tightly packed, and cannot move past one another but vibrate. Liquid: A substance that has a definite volume, but no definite shape is a liquid, taking on the shape of their container. The molecules in a liquid are constantly moving yet still in contact with one another. Gas: A substance with no definite shape or volume, gases take on the shape or volume of the container they are surrounded by. Molecules can move freely and have negligible intermolecular interactions. Phase Diagrams A phase diagram is like a map and predicts the phase of a substance according to its thermodynamic properties: \\( p \\), \\( T \\), \\( v \\), \\( u \\), and \\( h \\). An example of a \\( pv \\) liquid-vapor phase diagram for a pure substance is shown below: Figure 1: A \\(pv\\) liquid-vapor phase diagram for a pure substance illustrating the critical point, vapor dome, and liquid and vapor regions. Critical Point: Point at which at lesser pressures the substance exists as either a liquid or vapor, and above exists as a supercritical fluid. Vapor Dome: Region within the dome-like curve known as the two-phase region, where some part of the substance is in a liquid phase, and some part is in a vapor phase. The substance is in a liquid phase when its \\( p \\) and \\( v \\) lie in the region to the left of the vapor dome and in a vapor phase when its \\( p \\) and \\( v \\) lie in the region to the right of the vapor dome. If \\( v \\) lies at the intersection of the isotherm and the left side of the vapor dome, the system is said to be in the saturated liquid state with specific volume \\( v_f \\). If \\( v \\) lies at the intersection of the isotherm and the right side of the vapor dome, the system is said to be in the saturated vapor state \\( v_g \\). If the system is halfway between the liquid and vapor states (see Figure 2) such that the mass of the liquid portion \\( m_f \\) equals the mass of the vapor portion \\( m_g \\), then its quality \\( x \\) is given by $$ x \\equiv \\frac{m_g}{m_f + m_g} = 0.5 $$ Figure 2: A \\(pv\\) liquid-vapor phase diagram for a pure substance illustrating thermodynamic properties that define the two-phase region. Supercritical Fluid: Phase of the substance when existing above the critical point, and possesses characteristics similar to both liquids and gases, but strictly behaves as neither. Isotherm: For a given \\( p \\) and \\( v \\), the substance's \\( T \\) lies on an isotherm. The segment of the isotherm within the vapor dome is horizontal because phase transitions occur at a constant \\( T \\) and \\( p \\). State of a Substance: If any two independent intensive variables are known (\\( T, v, p, x, h, u \\)), they fix the state of the substance. (Intensive variables are independent of mass. For example, specific volume \\( v \\) is intensive. Volume \\( V=mv \\) is not.) Critical Values and Ideal Gases Ideal gases are modeled as having internal energy entirely composed of kinetic energy due to the absence of any interactions between the particles of the gas, which occurs when: The particles are far away from each other, at lower pressure or density the kinetic energy of the particles is so large as to render the energy due to interactions between them negligible, at high temperature Reduced Values: Low and high are relative terms and depend on the particular gas, specifically its phase behavior. Reduced values are normalized with respect to their values at the critical point to describe where gases are far enough away from the vapor dome to behave ideally, (\\( p_c \\), \\( v_c \\), and \\( T_c \\)). The following expressions $$ p_R = p/p_c \\qquad T_R = T/T_c \\qquad v_R^\\prime = \\frac{v}{R(T_c/p_c)} $$ define the reduced pressure, reduced temperature, and pseudoreduced specific volume. Compressibility factor: The compressibility factor, \\( Z \\), for an ideal gas equals 1, meaning a gas behaves ideally at infinitely small \\( p \\). Therefore, the more deviation of Z from unity the less ideally a gas behaves. Compressibility factor \\(Z\\) $$ Z = \\frac{pv}{RT} $$ Ideal Gases A gas is a state of matter that has neither independent shape nor volume. When contained, the atoms or molecules that comprise it interact with every boundary of the container. Ideal Gas Assumptions An ideal gas is a hypothetical model of a gas that follows the assumptions that molecules are infinitesimally small (just points in space) ideal gas molecules never collide with one another ideal gas molecules occupy no volume intermolecular forces are zero ideal gas molecules have no potential energies between molecules internal energy is only a function of kinetic energy Figure 3: A sub-volume of gas next to a sub-section of the container wall having area, \\(A\\). Equation of State It has been shown empirically that an ideal gas obeys the equation of state Ideal-gas law $$ pV=n\\overline{R}T $$ \\(\\overline{R}\\) in different unit systems $$ \\overline{R} = \\begin{cases} \t&8.314 \\textrm{ kJ/kmol}\\cdot\\textrm{K}\\\\\t&1.986 \\textrm{ Btu/lbmol}\\cdot\\textrm{\\(^\\circ\\)R}\\\\\t&1545 \\textrm{ ft \\(\\cdot\\)lbf/kmol}\\cdot\\textrm{\\(^\\circ\\)R}\\\\\t\\end{cases} $$ Temperature Effects \\( \\overline{R} \\) defines the proportionality constant that converts the average translational kinetic energy of a single particle, \\( \\langle KE\\rangle \\), to temperature (\\( N_A \\) is Avagadro's number) Temperature-Kinetic energy relation $$ T = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{N_A}{\\overline{R}}\\langle KE \\rangle. $$ Internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on the total molecular kinetic energy. Therefore, internal energy is solely a function of the temperature, \\( T \\), and mass of the gas, \\( m \\). The rate of change of the specific internal energy, \\( u \\), where \\( u = U/m \\), of an ideal gas with respect to \\( T \\) is its , \\( c_v \\) Constant volume specific heat \\(c_v\\) in an ideal gas $$ \\frac{du}{dT} = c_v $$ It follows that the change in internal energy of an ideal gas due to a change in temperature from \\( T_1 \\) to \\( T_2 \\) is given by Internal energy-temperature relationship $$ \\Delta U = U_2 - U_1 = m\\int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_v dT. $$ Incompressible Fluids In the incompressible substance model, the volume of a quantity of a substance cannot be compressed or expanded, thus its specific volume is constant. Internal Energy of Incompressible Fluids Because the specific volume is not changing, the average intermolecular potential energy, which from the average distance between molecules, cannot change. Thus, the only contribution to an incompressible substance's internal energy comes from atomic and molecular kinetic energy, quantified via temperature. It follows that, like the ideal gas model, the internal energy of an incompressible substance is a function of temperature only and $$ u = u(T) $$ Constant volume specific heat \\(c_v\\) in an incompressible fluid $$ \\frac{du}{dT} = c_v $$ Specific Heat of Incompressible Fluids For an incompressible substance, constant pressure specific heat \\( c_p \\) equals constant volume specific heat \\( c_v \\). \\( c_p \\) is defined as the partial derivative of the enthalpy \\( h \\), while pressure \\( p \\) is held constant. Constant pressure specific heat $$ c_p \\equiv \\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial T}\\right)_p. $$ By definition \\( h = u+pv \\), thus at constant \\( p \\) and for an incompressible substance (constant \\( v \\)), we can write the partial derivative of \\( h \\) with respect to \\( T \\) as $$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = \\frac{du}{dT} = c_v $$ where the conversion from a partial to total derivative arises because \\( u = u(T) \\) for an incompressible substance. Therefore \\( c_p = \\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = c_v \\) for an incompressible substance. \\(c_v\\) & \\(c_p\\) equivalence for incompressible substances $$ c_p = c_v = c $$ Specific Entropy Change of Incompressible Fluids For an ideal gas with a given, constant specific heat \\( c_v \\), its change in specific entropy from a state \\( 1 \\) to a state \\( 2 \\) is given by the expression Change in specific entropy $$ s_2 - s_1 = c_v\\ln\\frac{T_2}{T_1}+ R \\ln\\frac{v_2}{v_1} $$ where \\( R \\) is the gas constant and \\( v \\) is the specific volume. Assuming this ideal gas is incompressible, \\( v_2=v_1 \\). Therefore, $$ s_2 - s_1 = c_v\\ln\\frac{T_2}{T_1}+ R \\ln(1) $$ the ratio of \\( \\frac{v_2}{v_1}=1 \\) and the \\( ln(1)=0 \\), simplifying the change in specific entropy is Change in specific entropy for incompressible substances $$ s_2 - s_1 = c\\ln\\frac{T_2}{T_1}, $$ as long as \\( c \\) is constant.",

If these flow rates are known functions of time, then this equation implies that Mass-balance equation #MassBalanceInt $$ m(t) = m(0) + \\int_0^t \\left( \\sum_{in}\\dot{m}_{in}(\\tau) - \\sum_{out}\\dot{m}_{out}(\\tau)\\right) d\\tau, $$ where \\( m(0) \\) is the initial value of the mass in the system at time \\( t=0 \\). Integrating Eqn. MassBalanceInt with respect to time yields. Result of mass-balance equation #MassBalanceInt2 $$ m(t) - m(0) = \\Delta m = \\sum_{in}m_{in}- \\sum_{out}m_{out} $$ where \\( m_{in} \\) and \\( m_{out} \\) are the total quantities of mass transferred in or out of the system for a given set of processes. Figure2: A system whose state is changing due to mass flow. Given the thermodynamic system shown in Figure 2, one can write the rate of change of mass of the system equals the following quantity, $$ \\dot{m}_{in,1} +\\dot{m}_{in,2} - \\dot{m}_{out,1} $$ Volume and Volume Flow The volume \\( V \\) of a system is an extensive parameter for describing its thermodynamic state. The specific volume \\( v \\), an intensive property, is the system's volume per unit mass. Volume is a function of state and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as pressure and temperature. Specific Volume Specific volume is the volume per unit mass Specific volume equation and units $$ v=\\frac{V}{m}={\\frac{\\textrm{m}^3}{\\textrm{kg}}} $$ Volume Flow As mass flows into a system, energy increases by the addition of both the internal energy of the additional mass and the \\( pV \\) work done by the volume occupied by the mass on the system as it enters, and vice versa. A mass flow having rate \\( \\dot{m} \\) with cross-sectional area, \\( A \\), slowly enters a system. The mass is at a pressure \\( p \\), has a specific volume \\( v \\), and has a specific internal energy, \\( u \\), relative to some reference state. The mass flows into the system, over a given time interval \\( \\Delta t \\), increasing the internal energy of the system as it enters, by: Mass-flow & internal energy relationship #Deltau_dotm $$ \\dot{m}\\Delta t u=mu. $$ The volume occupied by the portion of the stream entering a system is defined by, Volume in-flow $$ V_{\\text{in-flow}}=\\dot{m}\\Delta t v=mv $$ This volume is pushed at constant pressure, \\( p \\), into the system, is doing \\( pV \\) work on the system, which will be described further in section \\(pV\\) work. Energy and Energy Flow Internal Energy The internal energy, \\( U \\), of a thermodynamic system relative to some reference state \\( U_0 \\) is the energy required to set up the positions and motions of the atoms and molecules within the system from their positions and motions in the reference state. When the system is in its reference state, its relative internal energy equals \\( 0 \\). External energy balance $$ \\Delta U = U - U_0 = \\textrm{energy}_{in} - \\textrm{energy}_{out} $$ The addition of energy to a system in its reference state will result in the system having a positive relative internal energy. The removal of energy from a system in its reference state will result in the system having a negative relative internal energy. Eqn.MassBalanceInt2. Figure 3: A schematic representation of a thermodynamic system illustrating energy flows. Internal Energy Contributions The internal energy (\\( U \\)) of a system is affected by the energetic contributions from heat flow (\\( Q \\)) in and out of a system and work (\\( W \\)) done by or on a system. Internal energy balance $$ \\Delta U = Q - W. $$ Sign Convention: These energetic changes affect thermodynamic systems as follows: When heat is transferred to the system, the system energy increases (positive heat transfer). When the system does work on its surroundings, the system energy decreases (negative sign in front of work done by system). When the system transfers heat to the surroundings, the system energy decreases (negative heat transfer). When work is done on to the system, the system energy increases (positive sign in front of work done on system). Figure 4: A schematic illustrating the direction of energy flow when heat is transferred to/from the system and work is performed on or by the system. Given the system shown in Figure 4, the net work done by the system is \\( W_1-W_2 \\). The net heat transferred to the system is \\( Q_1-Q_2 \\). The change in system energy is Change in total system energy $$ \\Delta U = Q_1-Q_2-(W_1-W_2). $$ Potential Energy A system may find itself subject to a conservative force in a position that differs from a reference position. In this scenario, work has been done against a conservative force, such as changing the height, \\( h \\), to change the potential energy. Typical conservative forces include elastic potential energy, e.g., a spring, and electric potential energy. For the particular case of gravity, Potential energy $$ \\begin{split}W_{\\text{PE}_g}&=\\int_{z_1}^{z_2}mg\\,dz\\\\&=mg(z_2-z_1)\\end{split} $$ Thus the change in the gravitational potential energy of the system. Work done by potential energy $$ W_{\\text{PE}_g}=\\Delta \\text{PE}_g $$ Kinetic Energy A system may find itself in motion with respect to a reference frame. In this first case, work has been done to accelerate the system to its velocity. Work done is defined by forces acting over a distance, and work \\( W_{\\text{KE}} \\) can be done to accelerate the system to its velocity, Work-force relationship $$ W_{\\text{KE}}=\\int_{\\vec{x_1}}^{\\vec{x_2}}\\vec{f}\\,d\\vec{x}. $$ Force is determined from Newton's 2nd law: Newton's second law $$ \\vec{f}=m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}=m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{d\\vec{x}}\\underbrace{\\frac{d\\vec{x}}{dt}}_{\\vec{v}}=m\\vec{v}\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{d\\vec{x}} $$ This results in the following relationship for work done via kinetic energy change (\\( W_{\\text{KE}} \\)) Work-momentum relationship $$ \\begin{split}W_{\\text{KE}}&=\\int_{\\vec{v_1}}^{\\vec{v_2}}m\\vec{v}\\,d\\vec{v}\\\\&=\\frac{1}{2}m(\\vec{v}_2^2-\\vec{v}_1^1).\\end{split} $$ Thus the change in kinetic energy of the system. Work done by kinetic energy $$ W_{\\text{KE}}=\\Delta \\text{KE} $$ Enthalpy Enthalpy is a state function that is the sum of a system's internal energy \\( \\mu \\) and the product of its pressure and volume \\( pv \\). Relative Specific Enthalpy The sum \\( u+pv \\) appears frequently in thermodynamic discussion so it is conveniently defined as relative specific enthalpy \\( h \\), consisting of the same atomic and molecular kinetic and potential energies as specific internal energy \\( u \\), but with the addition of flow work, \\( pv \\) Relative enthalpy #RelativeEnthalpy $$ h=u+pv. $$ Entropy The topic of entropy is discussed on this page.",

    "title": "Cams",
    "text": "Cams  Introduction to Cams Cams are mechanical devices that allow a design to convert an input motion into pre-programmed output motion. A cam mechanism is comprised of two main components: the cam and the follower. The follower is in constant contact with the cam and, as the cam moves, it follows the geometry of the cam to produce an output motion. Cams come in all shapes and sizes, resulting in many useful characterizations of their form and function. Cam geometries can be split into three categories: Radial - The follower's motion is perpendicular to the cam's axis of rotation. Cylindrical - The follower's motion is parallel to the cam's axis of rotation. Axial - The cam itself slides on a linear path. Radial Cam Cylindrical Cam Axial Cam Followers are ideally 1-DOF mechanisms. Two methods to restrict the follower's degree of freedom are: Rotating - The follower is restricted to rotate about an axis. Translating - The follower is restricted to slide inside a channel. Figure 2: Follower Motion Types Followers must be in constant contact with the cam to ensure it follows the cam's geometry. Two methods of achieving constant contact are: Force closed - The follower is pressed into the cam by a force, e.g. from a spring or gravity. Form closed - The follower is held in place by the geometry of the cam. Figure 3: Follower Closure Types The point of contact between the follower and the cam is a major source of friction and wear, making the design of the follower is extremely important. The follower's shape can be generally placed in two categories: Roller - A small wheel on the follower rolls along the cam's profile. This has the least friction, but is expensive to manufacture and maintain. Static - There are no moving parts on the follower, and the follower simply slides along the cam's profile. There are multiple static geometries to choose from, such as mushroom, flat-faced, and knife-edge. Figure 4: Follower Shapes The pressure angle \\( \\phi \\) is defined as the angle between the velocity of the follower and the direction of the axis of transmission. A high pressure angle can cause excessive friction and wear and can even jam the mechanism. The pressure angle should not exceed \\( 30^\\circ \\) for translating followers and \\( 35^\\circ \\) for rotating followers. Figure 5: Pressure Angle Motion Programing The easiest way to design a cam profile is to divide the follower's motion into a piecewise function \\( s (\\theta) \\), whose domain is \\( [0^\\circ,360^\\circ) \\). Each subdomain is assigned one of the following three functions: Dwell - The follower is maintained at a constant position. Rise - The follower is raised to desired position. Fall - The follower is lowered to a desired position. Figure 6: Demonstration of Parts of Motion Program When designing a cam, the following variables must be considered: Displacement - \\( s (\\theta) \\) Velocity - \\( v (\\theta) =\\dot{s}(\\theta) \\) Acceleration - \\( a (\\theta) =\\ddot{s}(\\theta) \\) Jerk - \\( j (\\theta) =\\dddot{s}(\\theta) \\) These variables can be represented by plotting their values across the entire surface of the CAM. Since we are plotting Displacement (S), Velocity (V), Acceleration (A), and Jerk (J) we call this an SVAJ plot. Fundamental Law of Cam Design: When designing a cam, it is critical that the position, velocity, and acceleration of the follower motion are continuous. Additionally, the jerk must be finite because rapid changes in jerk can excite harmonics in the cam system, causing vibrations. Cam Profiles The Fundamental Law of Cam Design helps us define boundary conditions for the rise or fall segment. Afterwards, each section can be pieced together to from a whole rotation. This section includes several cam profile examples, but is by no means an exhaustive list. Each example assumes a rise-dwell-fall-swell cam profile with \\( 90^\\circ \\) for each section. Let us first look at a trapezoidal profile to see why linear functions, though simple, are not a good idea. Think of a trapezoidal rise or fall section as a simple ramp, so the entire \\( s (\\theta) \\) graph looks like a trapezoid. We call this the trapezoidal profile. (Note that in the below equations \\( h \\) is how high the cam rises and falls) Trapezoidal Position $$ s(\\theta)= \\begin{cases} 0 & 0^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 90^\\circ \\\\ \\frac{h}{90^\\circ}(\\theta-90^\\circ)& 90^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 180^\\circ \\\\ h & 180^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 270^\\circ \\\\ h-\\frac{h}{90^\\circ}(\\theta-270^\\circ) & 270^\\circ\\leq \\theta < 360^\\circ \\end{cases} $$ Figure 7: Trapezoidal Position The position function is continuous. But taking the derivative of \\( s(\\theta) \\), we can see that the velocity function is not. Trapezoidal Velocity $$ v(\\theta)= \\begin{cases} 0 & 0^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 90^\\circ \\\\\\frac{h}{90^\\circ} & 90^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 180^\\circ \\\\ 0 & 180^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 270^\\circ \\\\-\\frac{h}{90^\\circ} & 270^\\circ\\leq \\theta < 360^\\circ \\end{cases} $$ Figure 8: Trapezoidal Velocity This will result in spikes of infinite acceleration. Figure 9: Trapezoidal Acceleration Now, let's enforce continuous velocity boundary conditions where the rise and fall sections meet with the dwell section. One equation that satisfies this is a sine function similar to that of simple harmonic motion, hence we call this the simple harmonic profile. (Note that \\( \\beta \\) is the angular interval of the function. For all following examples, \\( \\beta=90^\\circ \\).) Harmonic Velocity $$ v(\\theta)=\\frac{\\pi}{\\beta}\\frac{h}{2}\\sin\\left({\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{\\beta}}\\right) $$ Figure 10: Harmonic Velocity We can find \\( s(\\theta) \\) for the rise section by integrating \\( v(\\theta) \\) and enforcing the boundary conditions \\( s(\\theta)=0 \\) and \\( s(\\theta)=h \\), as shown below. We can also get the profile for the fall section by reflecting the rise portion by reflecting the rise portion across the horizontal axis, then shifting it upwards by \\( h \\). Harmonic Position $$ s(\\theta)=\\frac{h}{2}\\left[1-\\cos\\left({\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{\\beta}}\\right)\\right] $$ Figure 11: Harmonic Position Both \\( s(\\theta) \\) and \\( v(\\theta) \\) are continuous. But when we consider its acceleration function, we can see that it is discontinuous at the section transitions, meaning jerk is infinite at these locations. Harmonic Acceleration $$ a(\\theta)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{\\beta^2}\\frac{h}{2}\\cos\\left({\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{\\beta}}\\right) $$ Figure 12: Harmonic Acceleration Thus, a better approach to this problem is to design an acceleration function that is continuous and then integrate and apply boundary conditions to get the position and velocity equations. Let's start by prescribing a continuous sinusoidal acceleration function. The coefficient \\( 2\\pi\\frac{h}{\\beta^2} \\) was found by integrating \\( a(\\theta) \\) with an unknown coefficient then applying boundary conditions \\( s(0)=0 \\), \\( s(\\beta)=h \\), \\( v(\\theta)=0 \\), \\( v(\\beta)=0 \\), \\( a()=0 \\), \\( a(\\beta)=0 \\). We call this a Cycloidal profile. Cycloidal Acceleration $$ a(\\theta)=2\\pi\\frac{h}{\\beta^2}\\sin(2\\pi\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}) $$ Figure 13: Cycloidal Acceleration We can integrate to get the velocity and position function and differentiate to get the jerk function. Cycloidal Position $$ s(\\theta)=h\\left[\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}-\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin\\left(2\\pi\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}\\right)\\right] $$ Figure 14: Cycloidal Position Cycloidal Velocity $$ v(\\theta)=\\frac{h}{\\beta}\\left[1-\\cos\\left(2\\pi\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}\\right)\\right] $$ Figure 14: Cycloidal Velocity Cycloidal Jerk $$ j(\\theta)=4\\pi^2\\frac{h}{\\beta^3}\\cos\\left(2\\pi\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}\\right) $$ Figure 14: Cycloidal Jerk Note that the position, velocity, and acceleration functions are all continuous and the jerk is finite. However, there is still room for improvement. A steep acceleration function can still create large jumps in jerk. InlineEquation equation=\"\\ a(\\\\theta)\"/> Instead of using trigonometric functions, we can construct a polynomial position function that has continuous jerk and enforce position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk boundary conditions on it. In total, there are 8 boundary conditions \\( s(0)=0 \\), \\( s(\\beta)=h \\), \\( v(\\theta)=0 \\), \\( v(\\beta)=0 \\), \\( a()=0 \\), \\( a(\\beta)=0 \\),\\( j(j)=0 \\),\\( j(\\beta)=0 \\) so our polynomial will be degree 7 (therefore, 8 unknown coefficients). Polynomial Position $$ s(\\theta)=h\\sum_{k=0}^7 C_k\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}\\right)^k $$ Solving for coefficients \\( C_0...C_7 \\) gives us: 4-5-6-7 Polynomial Position $$ s(\\theta)=h\\left(35\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}\\right)^4-84\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}\\right)^5+70\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}\\right)^6-20\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}\\right)^7\\right) $$ Figure 15: Polynomial Position Figure 16: Polynomial Velocity Figure 17: Polynomial Acceleration Figure 18: Polynomial Jerk This is known as the 4-5-6-7 polynomial profile. We can also use a similar process to create other profile shapes given a set of boundary conditions. Cam Profile Selection Selecting the right cam profile for your application doesn't depend solely on continuous jerk. For example, if your mechanism has weak joints but is not susceptible to vibrations, you may want to select a cam profile with low peak acceleration (e.g. modified trapezoidal). If you want to smooth out your follower motion, you may want to select a cam profile with lower peak velocity (e.g. sinusoidal). If you want to decrease the pressure angle, you may want to select a cam profile with a less aggressive slope (i.e. harmonic). The following is a comparison of the rise SVAJ plots of the four profiles covered so far. Figure 19: Polynomial Jerk Function Transformation You may have noticed that the vertical scale has been omitted and the horizontal scale for the rise and fall sections is set arbitrarily at \\( \\beta=90^\\circ \\) for all graphs so far. This is because you can achieve any vertical and horizontal scaling from a normalized rise function. Suppose that we have a normalized rise function, \\( s_0(\\theta) \\), where \\( s_0(0)=0 \\) and \\( s_0(1)=1 \\). Using function transformations, we can transform \\( s_0(\\theta) \\) to go from any \\( s_0(\\theta_i)=h_i \\) to \\( s_0(\\theta_f)=h_f \\), where \\( \\theta_f=\\theta_i+\\beta \\). 4-5-6-7 Polynomial Position $$ s(\\theta)=(h_f-h_i)s_0\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}-\\theta_i\\right)+h_i $$",

    "title": "Instant centers",
    "text": "Instant Centers  Instant Centers Intro From previous experiences with mechanisms, one may recall that any rigid body has an angular velocity. Furthermore, one may recall that an angular velocity can create a linear velocity according to the equation: Velocity Calculation for Rigid Body #IC_1 $$ v_a=v_b + r_{b \\rightarrow a} \\times \\omega $$ Figure 1: Velocity Calculation for Rigid Body In this figure Where \\( A \\) is the velocity of the point attached to the rigid body that we are interested in, \\( B \\) is another point that we know the velocity of on the rigid body, \\( r_{b \\rightarrow a} \\) is the position vector from point \\( A \\) to \\( B \\), and \\( \\omega \\) is the angular velocity of the rigid body. If we look closer at the above equation, we can see that by changing the position of point \\( A \\), we will change \\( r_{b \\rightarrow a} \\), which will change \\( v_a \\). This means that for any value of \\( v_a \\) we can find a position \\( A \\) that will make the equation hold true. Note: This point may not be on the rigid body. This is okay, we just need to treat the point \\( A \\) as if it were connected to the same rigid body, even if it is not. Lets now consider a pair of two rigid bodies. We know that each of these rigid bodies may have its own \\( \\omega \\). However, since we know we can select a point \\( A \\) so that it can have any velocity, that means that we can find a point where the velocities of both rigid bodies are the same. More precisely, if we know the velocity of point \\( B \\) on rigid body \\( 1 \\), and the velocity of point \\( C \\) on rigid body \\( 2 \\), we can find point \\( A \\) such that: Equal Velocities at Instant Center #IC_2 $$ v_b + r_{b \\rightarrow a} \\times \\omega_1= v_c + r_{c \\rightarrow a} \\times \\omega_2 $$ Figure 2: Equal Velocities at Point A Figure 3: Velocity at A relative to B Figure 4: Velocity at A relative to C We call point \\( A \\) where the linear velocities of both rigid bodies are the same the Instant Center, or IC, of these two rigid bodies. This is because at a given instant, we can treat point \\( A \\) as the center or axis of rotation. The unique properties of instant centers allow us to quickly compute the velocities of different elements in a mechanism. Finding Instant Centers The first step in using instant centers to compute velocity information in a mechanism is to identify where the instant centers are. We can find an instant center for each pair of rigid bodies in a mechanism. This means that for a mechanism with \\( \\) links, the total number of instant centers can be computed using the following equation. Number of Instant Centers #IC_3 $$ \\text{Number of IC's}=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $$ Thus, a 4 bar mechanism would have 6 IC's, and a 6 bar mechanism would have 15. It can be easy to overlook or miss an IC. One useful way of keeping track of these IC's is to make use of a simple circle diagram. Begin by drawing a circle, and label points along the circumference, one point for each rigid body in the mechanism. As each instant center is identified, draw a line that connects the two rigid bodies that define that instant center. This creates an easy method to keep track of IC's and ensure that none are missed. Figure 5: Circle Diagram Method for Tracking IC's Once we know the number of instant centers we are looking for, there are a few simple rules that will help us find all of them. Rule 1: Each pin joint is an IC A pin joint constraints two or more rigid bodies to have the exact same linear velocity at a point, even if they have different angular velocities. Thus, a pin joint creates an instant center between those two objects Rule 2: Kennedy's Theorem 3 bodies that are in the same plane will have their instant centers lie along a line. Commonly called Kennedy's theorem, this rule is often used to find the instant centers between rigid bodies that are not in contact with one another. From our number of instant centers equation, we know that 3 bodies will have \\( \\frac{3(3-1)}{2}=3 \\) IC's. If we can find two of them, then we know that the third instant center must also be on the line that passes through the previous two. If we are able to do this process with another set of instant centers, we can get two different lines that the instant center must lie on. Since the instant center must be on both of these lines, it must exist at the intersection of the two lines. Rule 3: Sliding Joints The IC for a sliding joint is located at an infinite distance away from the mechanism, perpendicular to the sliding direction. In a sliding joint, there is no rotation, so how can two objects ever have the same linear velocity? By placing the instant center at infinity, we can treat the motion of the slider as a having a very small omega, and a very large radius, giving us an approximately linear motion. As the radius goes to infinity, the velocity will approach perfectly linear motion. Rule 4: Rolling without Slipping For two bodies in rolling contact without slipping, the contact point is their IC. If two bodies are rolling without slipping, they must have the same velocity at the contact point, meaning that this point is an instant center. Rule 5: Rolling with Slipping For two bodies in rolling contact with slipping, which we can think of as a combination of rolling (IC at contact point) and sliding (IC at infinity). As a result, we can deduce that the IC lies on a line normal to their plane of contact. Additionally, the IC lies on the same line as their common centers of rotation according to Kennedy's theorem. The third body can be thought of as the ground link, hence the pivots are two instant centers. Using Instant Centers Now that we have a method to reliably find the instant centers of a mechanism, we can use these instant centers to find the velocities of different elements of the mechanism. We can use instant centers to easily find the ratio of velocities between different elements. Any given point \\( p \\) can only have one translational velocity, \\( v_p \\). However, at an instant center, we know that these translational velocities are equivalent for two different rigid bodies. Thus, if we have velocity information for one element in a mechanism (angular or translational) we can use that to find velocity information for other elements. We can look at the following example to see this in more detail Begin by listing known information. In this case, we know the link lengths of a mechanism, as well as the angular velocity of the crank. Next, compute all of the instant centers on the mechanism. We then can consider the crank of the mechanism. We know that the pin between the crank and ground is an instant center. Since the ground link has a velocity of 0 everywhere, the crank will have a velocity of 0 at that location. Let's call the crank body 2, and the ground link body 1. Then, select another grounded linkage. This is the link that we will analyze. Let's call that body 3. Body 1 and body 3 will share an instant center, which we will call \\( A \\). Using \\( v_a=v_{IC_{1,2}}+r_{IC_{1,2} \\rightarrow a} \\times \\omega_2 \\) we can substitute in for \\( v_{IC_{1,2}}, r_{IC_{1,2} \\rightarrow a} \\) and \\( \\omega_2 \\) to find \\( v_a \\). We can reuse the above equation, but instead consider that point \\( A \\) is also attached to body 3. Thus, we could consider the velocity of point \\( A \\) as coming from the rotation of body 3 rather than the rotation of body 2. We would write this equation as \\( v_a=v_c+r_{c \\rightarrow a} \\times \\omega_3 \\). The biggest issue here is that we do not know where to place point \\( C \\) so that we know its velocity. If we place it at point \\( A \\), the radius will be 0, and we will be unable to compute \\( \\omega_3 \\). However, there is another location where we know the velocity of a point on body 3. If we consider \\( IC_{1,3} \\) we know that the ground has a velocity of 0 everywhere. Thus, at \\( IC_{1,3} \\), the ground and body 3 have the same speed, 0. This allows us to write \\( v_a=0+r_{IC_{1,3} \\rightarrow a} \\times \\omega_3 \\). Since we know all of these values except \\( \\omega_3 \\), we can then solve for \\( \\omega_3 \\). Now that \\( \\omega_3 \\) is known, we can compute \\( V_b \\), and \\( \\omega_4 \\). Additionally, this procedure can be repeated to find the velocities of all links in a mechanism. Using this style of procedure, we can use instant centers to compute the velocities of different elements of any mechanism.",

    "title": "Dynamic force analysis",
    "text": "Dynamic Force Analysis  Dynamic Force Analysis Intro Dynamic Force Analysis (commonly called DFA) is closely connected to PVA Analysis. After obtaining the motion of a system through PVA analysis, DFA obtains the forces acting on each link and joint in the system. This process of going from a known motion to the forces that would have caused such motion is called inverse kinematics. This is opposed to forward kinematics, where the motion of a system is determined given the external loading. In real life applications, both methods are used to analyze mechanisms. Most of the time, the largest loads will be external forces and torques, as well as inertial forces and torques. To simplify our analysis, we will neglect the influence of gravity. However, in cases where gravitational loads contribute significantly to the total loads on a system, it is important to include them. Review of Dynamics Concepts There are a couple of applicable dynamics concepts that are worth reviewing. Total mass tells us the resistance of an object to changes in linear acceleration given an external force. We can use Newton's second law to relate force, mass, and linear acceleration. Center of mass is the first moment of mass. This is essentially the weighted sum of masses times their distances from a reference point. For a discrete set of point masses, we can use summation. Center Of Mass 1 $$ \\vec{r}_{CG}=\\frac{\\sum{\\vec{r}_i m_i}}{\\sum{m}_i} $$ For continuous objects, we integrate over the entire volume to calculate the weighted sum. Center Of Mass 2 $$ \\vec{r}_{CG}=\\frac{\\int{\\vec{r}dm}}{\\int{dm}} $$ In practice, the center of mass of many common shapes has already been solved and tabulated in look-up tables. Such tables can be readily found online or in textbooks. If the object is placed in a uniform gravitational field, then the object's center of gravity will be at the same location. Additionally, a free object will always rotate about an axis that goes through its center of mass. Additional information about centers of mass, and a table of centers of masses for common objects is located on the Rigid Body Kinetics page. Moment of inertia is the second moment of mass. This tells us about an object's resistance to changes in angular acceleration. An object's moment of inertia is always considered around an axis of rotation. For example, the z-axis moment of inertia of a planar object can be calculated as such: Moment of Inertia $$ I_z=\\int_A{\\vec{r}^2dm} $$ Similar to the center of mass, the moment of inertia of common shapes about an object's center of mass have already been solved around the \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) axes and tabulated. Additional information about moments of inertia of mass, and a table of moments of inertia for common objects is located on the Rigid Body Kinetics page. The parallel axis theorem allows us to calculate the moment of inertia of an object about any axis away from the center of mass. Objects rarely rotate around their center of mass in reality, especially when the object is part of a linkage. As such, having a method to calculate an object's moment of inertia about an arbitrary axis (without redoing the integral) is useful. The parallel axis theorem states that given the moment of inertia, \\( I_{CM} \\), about an axis through the center of mass of an object of mass \\( M \\), the moment of inertia about a parallel axis that is distance \\( d \\) away from the center of mass is given by: Parallel Axis Theorem $$ I=I_{CM}+Md^2 $$ Radius of gyration is the distance, \\( k \\), is the distance from the axis of rotation at which the entire mass of the body, \\( M \\), would be concentrated to give the same moment of inertia. That is, \\( I=Mk^2 \\). Solving for \\( k \\) gives: Radius Of Gryration $$ k=\\sqrt{\\frac{I}{M}} $$ The cross product is a useful mathematical operation that takes two vectors as input and returns a vector as output, denoted by the \\( \\times \\) operator. Qualitatively, the magnitude of \\( \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b} \\) has the same length as the area of the parallelogram formed by \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\), and the direction is determined by the right hand rule. Point your right hand's index finger in the direction of \\( \\vec{a} \\) and the middle finger in the direction of \\( \\vec{b} \\), then straightening your thumb will give the direction of \\( \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b} \\). This also shows that the cross product is not communicative, i.e., \\( \\vec{b}\\times\\vec{a}=-(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}) \\). Quantitatively, we have two methods to easily calculate the magnitude of the cross product of two 2D vectors, \\( \\vec{a}=a_x\\hat{i}+a_y\\hat{j} \\) and \\( \\vec{b}=b_x\\hat{i}+b_y\\hat{j} \\). The first method takes the determinant of a matrix containing the components of \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\), as shown below: 2D Cross Product Magnitude 1 $$ ||\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}||=\\det\\begin{bmatrix}a_x & a_y\\\\b_x & b_y\\end{bmatrix} = a_xb_y-a_yb_x $$ The second method calculates the area of the parallelogram bounded by \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the angle between \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\): 2D Cross Product Magnitude 2 $$ ||\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}||=||\\vec{a}|| ||\\vec{b}||\\sin{\\theta} $$ 3D cross products are more challenging and require solving the determinant shown below. This is less useful in the context of DFA, since most linkages studied here operates in a plane. 3D Cross Product $$ \\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}=\\det\\begin{bmatrix}\\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\ a_x & a_y & a_z \\\\ b_x & b_y & b_z\\end{bmatrix} $$ Note that setting \\( a_z=b_z=0 \\) will yield the same result as the 2D case. DFA procedure Because we are dealing with multiple links, each applying forces and having forces applied onto it, we need a way to keep track of all the various forces. As such, the following notation will be used: \\( \\vec{F}_{ij} \\): Force link \\( i \\) exerts on link \\( j \\). From Newton's Third Law, \\( \\vec{F}_{ij}=-\\vec{F}_{ji} \\). \\( T_{ij} \\): Torque link \\( i \\) exerts on link \\( j \\). Fron Newton's Third law, \\( T_{ij}=-T_{ji} \\). \\( \\vec{R}_{ij} \\): Position of \\( \\vec{F}_{ij} \\) relative to the CG of link \\( j \\). Note that unlike forces, \\( \\vec{R}_{ij}\\neq\\vec{R}_{ji} \\) for this notation. Here is a brief overview of the DFA procedure: Draw the complete system. Label points, dimensions, external forces and torques, and kinematics. Create free-body diagram for each segment. Each free-body diagram should include a labeled coordinate system, external joint forces and torques, kinematics, internal forces and torques, and position vectors. It is highly recommended to follow the notation shown above for ease of bookkeeping. Symbolically write out equations of motion for each link. For planar mechanisms, this will involve two force equations and one torque equation, for a total of three equations of motion: Equations of Motion $$ \\begin{gather}\\sum{\\vec{F}_{ix}}=m_i\\vec{a}_{CGix} \\\\ \\sum{\\vec{F}_{iy}}=m_i\\vec{a}_{CGiy} \\\\ \\sum{T}_{iz}=I_{CGi}\\alpha_i \\end{gather} $$ Convert equations to matrix format \\( [A]\\{B\\}=\\{C\\} \\) . Matrix \\( [A] \\) contains all geometric information (e.g. position vectors). Vector \\( \\{B\\} \\) contains all unknown forces and torques. Vector \\( \\{C\\} \\) contains all dynamic information (e.g. external forces and torques, PVA analysis results, mass, moments of inertia). Insert known values into the matrix equation. Invert matrix \\( [A] \\) to solve for \\( \\{B\\} \\) using a computational tool of your choice (e.g. MATLAB or Python). DFA Walkthrough Let's first apply DFA on a simple two-link system to see how it works. Link 1 is the ground link, while link 2 rotates around point \\( O_2 \\) and is acted on by an external force \\( \\vec{F}_P \\). Link 2 has mass \\( m \\), length \\( l \\), and a uniform cross section. We want to find the reaction force \\( \\vec{F}_{12} \\) at \\( O_2 \\) and the driving torque \\( T_{12} \\). At this instant in time, the following parameters are known: Known Values $$ \\begin{matrix} m=1.5kg & I=0.3kg\\cdot{}m^2 \\\\F_p=(5,2)N & \\vec{A}_{CG2}=(4,1)\\frac{m}{s^2}\\\\ \\vec{R}_{12}=(-1,-3)m & \\vec{R}_{P2}=(1,3)m \\end{matrix} $$ The equations of motion will be easier to visualize if we isolate link 2 and draw its free-body diagram: Writing out each equation of motion gives: Equations of Motion $$ \\begin{matrix} x: & F_{12x}=m_{2}A_{CG2x}-F_{Px}\\\\y: & F_{12y}=m_{2}A_{CG2y}-F_{Py}\\\\T: & -R_{12y}F_{12x}+R_{12x}F_{12y}+T_{12}=I_{12}\\alpha_{2}-R_{Px}F_{Py}+R_{Py}F_{Px}\\end{matrix} $$ Next, group the known and unknown into \\( [A] \\), \\( \\{B\\} \\), and \\( \\{C\\} \\): Matrix Forms $$ \\begin{gather} [A]=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ -R_{12y} & R_{12x} & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\{B\\} =\\begin{Bmatrix}F_{12x}\\\\ F_{12y}\\\\ T_{12}\\end{Bmatrix} \\\\ \\{C\\} =\\begin{Bmatrix}m_{2}A_{CG2x}-F_{Px}\\\\m_{2}A_{CG2y}-F_{Py}\\\\I_{CG2}\\alpha_{2}-R_{Px}F_{Py}+R_{Py}F_{Px}\\end{Bmatrix} \\end{gather} $$ Putting the matrix equation together: Matrix Equation 1 $$ \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ -R_{12y} & R_{12x} & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{Bmatrix}F_{12x}\\\\ F_{12y}\\\\ T_{12}\\end{Bmatrix}=\\begin{Bmatrix}m_{2}A_{CG2x}-F_{Px}\\\\m_{2}A_{CG2y}-F_{Py}\\\\I_{CG2}\\alpha_{2}-R_{Px}F_{Py}+R_{Py}F_{Px}\\end{Bmatrix} $$ Substitute in all known values: Matrix Equation 2 $$ \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0\\\\3 & -1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{Bmatrix}F_{12x}\\\\F_{12y}\\\\T_{12}\\end{Bmatrix}=\\begin{Bmatrix}1.5*4-5\\\\1.5*1-2\\\\0.3*0.3-1*1.5+3*5\\end{Bmatrix} $$ Invert and solve: Matrix Equation 3 $$ \\begin{Bmatrix}F_{12x}\\\\F_{12y}\\\\T_{12}\\end{Bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0\\\\3 & -1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\\begin{Bmatrix}1\\\\-0.5\\\\14.4 \\end{Bmatrix}=\\begin{Bmatrix}1\\\\-0.5\\\\10.9 \\end{Bmatrix} $$ Now we can move on to a more complex example with multiple moving links. Below is a crank slider mechanism with an external force \\( \\vec{F}_p \\) applied at point \\( P \\). A motor drives link 2. The slider (link 4) slides along a horizontal surface with friction coefficient \\( \\mu \\). Assume that all kinematic and geometric information is known. The unknowns are: Unknowns $$ \\begin{gather} T_{12} \\\\ \\vec{F}_{12}=(F_{12x},F_{12y})\\\\ \\vec{F}_{32}=(F_{32x},F_{32y})\\\\ \\vec{F}_{23}=(F_{23x},F_{23y})\\\\ \\vec{F}_{43}=(F_{43x},F_{43y})\\\\ \\vec{F}_{34}=(F_{34x},F_{34y})\\\\ \\vec{F}_{14}=(F_{14x},F_{14y}) \\end{gather} $$ Note that we have the following redundant values: Redundant Equations $$ \\begin{gather} -\\vec{F}_{23}=\\vec{F}_{32} \\\\ -\\vec{F}_{34}=\\vec{F}_{43} \\end{gather} $$ Furthermore, we can use the friction coefficient to relate \\( F_{14} \\) and \\( F_{14y} \\). The sign of \\( F_{14y} \\) depends on the direction in which the slider is moving (that is, always opposite to the the velocity's direction). Slider Equations $$ F_{14x}=-sign(V_{CG4x}){\\mu}F_{14y}=\\pm{\\mu}F_{14y} $$ Thus, we can reduce the unknowns down to 8 independent unknowns, which will require 8 equations to solve: Unknowns $$ F_{12x},F_{12x},F_{32x},F_{32y},F_{43x},F_{43y},F_{14y},T_{12} $$ Next, draw the free body diagram for each link and write the respective equations of motion. For link 2: (Note that link 2 is identical to the link that was analyzed in the previous example.) Equations Link 2 $$ \\begin{matrix}x: & F_{12x}+F_{32x}=m_{2}A_{CG2x}\\\\y: & F_{12y}+F_{32y}=m_{2}A_{CG2y}\\\\T: & (R_{12x}F_{12y}-R_{12y}F_{12x})+(R_{32x}F_{32y}-R_{32y}F_{32x})+T_{12}=I_{CG2}\\alpha_{2}\\end{matrix} $$ For link 3: Equations Link 3 $$ \\begin{matrix}x: & F_{23x}+F_{43x}+F_{Px}=m_{3}A_{CG3x}\\\\y: & F_{23y}+F_{43y}+F_{Py}=m_{3}A_{CG3y}\\\\T: & (R_{23x}F_{23y}-R_{23y}F_{23x})+(R_{43x}F_{43y}-R_{43y}F_{43x})+(R_{Px}F_{Py}-R_{Py}F_{Px})=I_{CG3}\\alpha_{3}\\end{matrix} $$ Recall that \\( \\vec{F}_{23}=-\\vec{F}_{32} \\). Modified Equations Link 2 $$ \\begin{matrix}x: & -F_{32x}+F_{43x}+F_{Px}=m_{3}A_{CG3x}\\\\y: & -F_{32y}+F_{43y}+F_{Py}=m_{3}A_{CG3y}\\\\T: & (-R_{23x}F_{32y}+R_{23y}F_{32x})+(R_{43x}F_{43y}-R_{43y}F_{43x})+(R_{Px}F_{Py}-R_{Py}F_{Px})=I_{CG3}\\alpha_{3}\\end{matrix} $$ For link 4: Note that torque balance is unnecessary because we assume that all forces are assumed to act through the CG. Equations Link 4 $$ \\begin{matrix}x: & F_{14x}+F_{34x}=\\pm{\\mu}F_{14y}-F_{43x}=m_{4}A_{CG4x}\\\\y: & F_{14y}+F_{34y}=F_{14y}-F_{43y}=0\\end{matrix} $$ We can now gather the 8 equations into matrix form \\( [A]\\{B\\}=\\{C\\} \\). Matrix Definitions $$ \\begin{gather} [A]=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\-R_{12y} & R_{12x} & -R_{32y} & R_{32x} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & R_{23y} & -R_{23x} & -R_{43y} & R_{43x} & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & \\pm\\mu & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\{B\\}=\\begin{Bmatrix}F_{12x}\\\\F_{12y}\\\\F_{32x}\\\\F_{32y}\\\\F_{43y}\\\\F_{43y}\\\\F_{14y}\\\\T_{12}\\end{Bmatrix} \\\\ \\{C\\} = \\begin{Bmatrix}m_{2}A_{CG2x}\\\\m_{2}A_{CG2y}\\\\I_{CG2}\\alpha_{2}\\\\m_{3}A_{CG3x}-F_{Px}\\\\m_{3}A_{CG3y}-F_{Py}\\\\I_{CG3}\\alpha_{3}-(R_{Px}F_{Py}-{R_{Py}F_{Px}})\\\\m_{4}A_{CG4x}\\\\0\\end{Bmatrix} \\end{gather} $$ The final step is to solve for \\( \\{B\\} \\) by plugging in all known values, then taking the inverse of \\( [A] \\) and multiplying it by \\( \\{C\\} \\). i.e., \\( \\{B\\}=[A]^{-1}\\{C\\} \\). Application Notes If you have a mismatch between your number of equations and unknowns, there is likely a constraint on the problem that reduces the number of unknowns, or an equation that should not be included (sometimes this occurs with equations of the form \\( 0=0 \\)).",

    "title": "Graphical linkage synthesis",
    "text": "Graphical Linkage Synthesis  Graphical Linkage Synthesis Intro Kinematic synthesis (also known as mechanism synthesis) is the act of designing mechanisms with a specified motion to perform a specific task. Kinematic synthesis often follows this procedure: Define desired motion. Does your mechanism need to open and close a lid or mimic the way an animal walks? What is motion you are trying to achieve? Choose the mechanism type. Will it consist of a crank-rocker, a slider-crank, or some other type of mechanism? Specify the geometry. How long will the links be? What types of joints will be present and how many? Check for undesirable behaviors. Is there a toggle position or a change point in the motion of the mechanism? Before starting to design a mechanism, it is always encouraged to research existing solutions. One can often adapt an existing design to fit the given specifications by understanding similar problems and the mechanisms used to solve them. There are two main ways to generate or adapt linkages: path and position generation. Path Generation The goal of path generation is to make a point follow a predefined path. The point of interest is almost always on a coupler linkage. Cranks will always trace circles, rockers will trace arcs, and sliders trace straight lines which are uninteresting when trying to create a mechanism that follows a complex path. There are two approaches to path generation: the algebraic approach and using lookup tables. The algebraic approach is very labor intensive and involves finding the zeros of a multidimensional high order polynomial that increases in order as the number of linkages increases. This approach is beyond the scope of this course. A far better approach is to utilize lookup tables that show the path traveled by a coupler point and how the path changes as each linkage changes in length. The four bar linkage shown below is a simple model that is used to show how lookup tables can be used. In this linkage \\( L_1 \\) is the ground linkage while \\( L_2 \\) is the crank. \\( BP \\) represents the measurement from one joint to the coupler point \\( P \\). The angle between the coupler \\( L_3 \\) and link \\( BP \\) is represented as \\( \\gamma \\), which is known as the offset angle. By changing link lengths and angle gamma, there are many position paths that the coupler point \\( P \\) can travel. To simplify coupler curve tables, common ratios between linkage lengths are established. \\( L_1/L_2 \\) is known as the ground link ratio and \\( L_3/L_2 \\) is the coupler link ratio. \\( L_4/L_2 \\) is the output link ratio and \\( BP/L_2 \\) is called the offset link ratio. The table below shows different coupler curves for four-bar linkages where the coupler link, output link, and offset link ratios are all equal. The x-axis shows the offset angle (also known as the coupler angle), while the y-axis shows the common link ratio. Once you choose a desired path, you can read the coupler angle and common link ratio to build a mechanism that follows that exact path. If you want to change the length of a single link, there are additional tables for different links that can be used to select different types of motion. Position Generation Position generation focuses on a link following a prescribed position. In this case, the orientation of the link is also considered when generating the system. This is a very visual process of synthesis which involves drawing out your system. This section will go into a few different methods for using position generation. In order to follow along, you will need a compass, straight edge, and writing device. More complex mechanisms may also require a protractor. Bisecting a Line with a Compass One of the most important fundamental skills for position generation is the ability to construct a perpendicular bisector for a line. Draw two points. Using your compass, draw a circle with a radius that is a little larger than halfway between the two points. Carefully pick up your compass and move it to rest on the other point without changing the radius. Draw another circle between the two points. If you did it right, there should be two intersecting points on the arcs. Line up a ruler with the two intersecting points and draw a straight line. Erase your arcs and you are left with a line that perfectly bisects the two points. Two Position synthesis: Crank Output One of the most common position generation problems is two-position synthesis. In this problem, the goal is to select link lengths and point positions that will move the rocker in a crank-rocker linkage from one position to another. Crank output position synthesis is a good choice if you desire your linkage to follow the path of an arc. Draw the desired start and end position for a rocker. Bisect the start and end points. This will represent the rocker's middle position. Draw a straight line connecting the start and end point of the rocker. Choose a point where you want the ground position of your crank to be. Using the distance between the start and the bisecting line as your radius, draw a circle around the ground position of your crank. Place a joint on the circle and connect the ground to your new joint to create your crank. Once you draw in your rocker, you are finished! Two Position synthesis: Coupler Output A slightly more complex challenge arises when the goal is to create a mechanism that will move the coupler of a four bar linkage from one position to another. Choose the start and end position of your coupler. In this instance, the start position is labeled with the subscript 1 while the end position is labeled with the subscript 2. Therefore, joint \\( C_1 \\) is the start position while joint \\( C_2 \\) is the end position. Bisect one of the start and end pairs of joints (in this case \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\)). Choose a position along this line to place a ground joint. This will form one of the linkages connecting to the coupler. Bisect the other pair of start and end joints. Draw another ground point anywhere along the line. This will be the last joint in the four bar linkage. Erase all bisecting lines and draw your linkages. You have now completed coupler output synthesis! Rotopole Synthesis Another approach to the previous two position synthesis problem is to extend the rocker and use it to move between the two positions. This type of mechanism is called a Rotopole. Start with your two desired linkage positions. Similar to coupler output synthesis, bisect one of the start and end pairs of joints (in this case \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\)). Bisect the other pair of start and end joints. The place where the two bisecting lines intersect is where the ground joint will be placed. Connect your linkage to your ground joint using one linkage and you are left with a rotopole. Dyad Driver When designing the rotopole, we did not consider the crank or coupler. Fortunately, we can design these links to move the rocker the proper amount. The process of adding a crank and coupler to an existing mechanism (Whether it is a rotopole or other rocker) to move it the proper amount is called adding a \"dyad driver\". Start with your rotopole or rocker mechanism and choose a point on the already existing linkage. This has been labeled \\( B_1 \\) for the starting position and \\( B_2 \\) for the ending position. Draw a straight line connecting the start and end position of the chosen point. Extend this line out of the way of the mechanism's motion. Choose a point on this line to place the ground joint for the crank. Bisect the two chosen points (\\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\)). Use the distance between one of the points as the radius of the crank. Create the crank linkage and add a linkage to attach the coupler to the mechanism. Your dyad driver is now complete. Quick Return Quick return mechanisms are used to vary the speed of a mechanism throughout its motion while still utilizing a constant input angular velocity. For example, a crank rocker with a quick-return mechanism will move faster in one direction than in the other. By changing the direction of the crank rotation, the direction of faster rotation will also change. The most important parameter of a quick return mechanism is its \"time ratio\" which is the ratio of the time it takes to move in one direction divided by the time it takes to move in the opposite direction. For example, a time ratio of 1.5 would mean that if it takes 1 second to move the mechanism forward, it would take 1.5 seconds to move it back. To achieve a time ratio other than 1 with a constant angular velocity crank input, the arc of the crank that it takes to move in one direction, \\( \\alpha \\) needs to be smaller than the arc that it takes to move in the other, \\( \\beta \\). This gives rise to the following system of equations. Alpha Beta #AB $$ \\alpha +\\beta= 2\\pi $$ Delta #D $$ \\delta=\\frac{\\beta-\\alpha}{2} $$ Time Ratio #TR $$ \\text{Time Ratio}= \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} $$ Given a time ratio, this system of equations can be solved for the 3 unknown parameters \\( \\alpha \\), \\( \\beta \\), and \\( \\delta \\). However, delta can also be solved directly using the following equation. Time Ratio 2 #TR2 $$ \\text{Time Ratio}=\\frac{\\pi+\\delta}{\\pi-\\delta} $$ Regardless of the method, once the value of \\( \\delta \\) for a given time ratio has been calculated, the synthesis can be preformed. Start with the desired start (\\( B_1 \\)) and ending (\\( B_2 \\)) position of a rocker. Draw a line anywhere through the starting position at any convenient angle. Draw a line through the end position (\\( B_2 \\)) and extend it until it intersects with your initial line at an angle \\( \\delta \\). This intersection will become the ground joint for the crank. Center your compass around the new ground joint and extend the radius until it reaches the end position. Draw an arc that intersects with both of the lines. Label this intersection point \\( P \\). The distance between \\( P \\) and \\( B_1 \\) is will become the diameter of the crank. If you are using a compass, bisect points \\( P \\) and \\( B_1 \\) to get the radius of the crank. Draw the links in and a quick return crank rocker is left over.",

    "title": "Position velocity acceleration",
    "text": "Position Velocity Acceleration (PVA)  PVA Intro Position, Velocity, Acceleration (PVA) analysis is used to analytically determine the motion of a mechanism. Position determines the configuration of the mechanism. Velocity is used to understand the kinetic energy and momentum of the system. Finally, acceleration is used to understand the forces in the system. PVA takes the known geometry, initial configurations, and PVA data of one link (the inputs) and determines the PVA data for the other links (the outputs). Vector Calculus In PVA analysis, links are represented using vectors. Using complex vectors is the easiest way to represent the link data as it utilizes the link length \\( |R| \\) and starting link angle \\( \\theta \\) to create a vector. There are two forms of complex vectors that we will be focusing on: complex number form and polar form. Complex number form takes a Cartesian approach to complex numbers. Meanwhile polar form takes a polar approach (as the name suggests). Complex Number Form $$ \\overrightarrow R = |R|\\cos(\\theta) + j|R|\\sin(\\theta) $$ Polar Form $$ \\overrightarrow R=|R| e^{j\\theta} $$ The \\( j \\) in each vector represents the imaginary number \\( sqrt{-1} \\). The Euler formula can be used to break the polar form into the complex form. Euler Formula Form $$ e^{\\pm j\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + j\\sin(\\theta) $$ Let's look at the polar vector form. Angle \\( \\theta \\) depends on time because the system is not static. This means that taking the derivative of the angle with respect to time will give the angular velocity \\( \\omega \\). Time Derivative of Polar Form $$ \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{j\\theta}) = je^{j\\theta}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = je^{j\\theta}\\omega $$ Also note that when you rotate a vector \\( \\overrightarrow R_{AB} \\) by 180 degrees, it becomes \\( -\\overrightarrow R_{AB} \\). Upon inspection, we can see that \\( -\\overrightarrow R_{AB} \\) is also equal to \\( \\overrightarrow R_{BA} \\). This can be a useful transformation to use when creating vector loops. Vector Loops Vector loops are used to create equations that can be used to solve complex linkage problems. Vector loops work by creating a \"loop\" of vectors that start and end in the same location. This also means that the sum of these vectors is equal to zero. For example, take a look at a four bar linkage. If you choose a joint and trace around the links in one direction (making position vectors along the way) you end up creating a vector loop. You can start the vector loop at any joint and go in any direction to finish the loop. Alternatively, you can start at one point and go two different directions to end at a different point. As long as the two paths start and end at the same point, a vector loop can be created. Since position, velocity, and acceleration are all path-independent vectors, we can usually write an equation in the form of \\( \\Sigma_0^n \\overrightarrow R_n=0 \\). This gives us an equation we are able to solve. Position Analysis Taking the same four bar linkage example as shown above, let us walk through position analysis. Identify known and unknown variables. In the four-bar linkage example, the linkage lengths (\\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\)) and the initial angle of the crank \\( (\\theta_2) \\) is known. The angle of the grounded link \\( (\\theta_1) \\) is known to be zero. The initial angle of the coupler \\( (\\theta_3) \\) and rocker \\( (\\theta_4) \\) are unknown. Establish a vector loop and write out the vectors in polar form. Recall that the polar form of a vector is in the form of \\( \\overrightarrow R=|R| e^{j\\theta} \\). Since the vector loop we established uses two different paths to get from the same starting point to the same ending point, we have to set the sum of the two paths equal to each other. Position Vector Loop Equations $$ \\begin{gather} \\overrightarrow R_2+\\overrightarrow R_3=\\overrightarrow R_4+\\overrightarrow R_1 \\\\ \\overrightarrow R_2+\\overrightarrow R_3-\\overrightarrow R_4-\\overrightarrow R_1 = 0 \\\\ \\overrightarrow R_{AO_2}+\\overrightarrow R_{BA}-\\overrightarrow R_{BO_4}-\\overrightarrow R_{O_4O_2} = 0 \\\\ ae^{j\\theta _2}+be^{j\\theta _3}-ce^{j\\theta _4}-de^{j\\theta _1} = 0 \\end{gather} $$ Break vector loop equation into real and imaginary parts. This can be done by using the Euler formula above. Position Vector Loop Equations in Cartesian Form $$ \\begin{gather} ae^{j\\theta_2}+be^{j\\theta_3}-ce^{j\\theta _4}-de^{j\\theta _1} = 0 \\\\ a(\\cos\\theta _2+j\\sin\\theta _2)+b(\\cos\\theta _3+j\\sin\\theta _3)-c(\\cos\\theta _4+j\\sin\\theta _4)-d(\\cos\\theta _1+j\\sin\\theta _1) = 0 \\end{gather} $$ Remember that \\( \\theta_1 \\) is equal to zero. This means that \\( d(\\cos\\theta_1+j\\sin\\theta_1) \\) simplifies to just \\( d+0j \\). Now we can easily break up the vector loop equation into its real and imaginary components. Real Component $$ a(\\cos\\theta _2)+b(\\cos\\theta _3)-c(\\cos\\theta _4) - d = 0 $$ Imaginary Component $$ a(\\sin\\theta _2)+b(\\sin\\theta _3)-c(\\sin\\theta _4) +0= 0 $$ Solve for unknown positions and/or angles. Since lengths \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are given along with angles \\( (\\theta_1) \\) and \\( (\\theta_2) \\), the unknowns are \\( (\\theta_3) \\) and \\( (\\theta_4) \\). Since there are two equations and two unknowns, this system can be solved using an equation solver. Velocity Analysis Before starting velocity analysis, you must complete position analysis. Now, we can walk through velocity analysis. Identify known and unknown variables. All of the variables found in position analysis are known (including \\( (\\theta_3) \\) and \\( (\\theta_4) \\) as those were solved for in the last step of position analysis).

Now we can walk through acceleration analysis. Identify known and unknown variables. In addition to the known values from the position and velocity analyses, \\( \\alpha_2 \\) is given.

The angular acceleration term \\( \\alpha \\) appears due to tangential, acceleration of the linkage while the \\( \\omega^2 \\) term appears due to the centripetal acceleration of the linkage. In total, four different types of acceleration can appear in acceleration analysis. For a refresher on these terms, refer to the particle kinematics page on the dynamics reference page. With this information, we can simplify the equation further to focus on the different acceleration terms: Simplified Acceleration Loop Equation $$ (j\\alpha _2\\overrightarrow R_2 - \\omega _2^2 \\overrightarrow R_2) + (j\\alpha _3 \\overrightarrow R_3 - \\omega _3^2\\overrightarrow R_3) - (j\\alpha _4\\overrightarrow R_4 - \\omega _4^2\\overrightarrow R_4) = 0 $$ Or more specifically, Reduced Acceleration Loop Equation $$ \\begin{gather}(\\overrightarrow A_A^t + \\overrightarrow A_A^n) + (\\overrightarrow A_{BA}^t+\\overrightarrow A_{BA}^n) - (\\overrightarrow A_B^t+ \\overrightarrow A_B^n) = 0 \\\\ \\overrightarrow A_A + \\overrightarrow A_{BA} - \\overrightarrow A_B = 0 \\end{gather} $$ Break vector loop equation into real and imaginary parts.

Application Notes If you have more unknowns than equations, you can likely create more vector loops. If this is the case, think carefully about the constraints on your problems. For example, take a look at this slider-crank example. If you create a position loop with three vectors, this leads to three unknowns (\\( \\theta_3 \\), \\( s(t) \\), and \\( \\beta (t) \\)). By breaking up the position loop into four position vectors, it makes it clear that there are only two unknowns (\\( \\theta_3 \\) and \\( d(t) \\)). This leads to the following position vector loop: Position Vector Loop for Crank Slider $$ ae^{j\\theta _2} - be^{j\\theta _3}-ce^{j\\theta _4}-de^{j\\theta _1}=0 $$ Since \\( \\theta_4 \\) equals 90 degrees and \\( \\theta_1 \\) equals zero degrees, the equation can be simplified to: Simplified Position Vector Loop for Crank Slider $$ ae^{j\\theta _2} - be^{j\\theta _3}-jc-d=0 $$ Real Component $$ a\\cos\\theta _2-b\\cos\\theta _3 -d =0 $$ Imaginary Component $$ asin\\theta _2 - bsin\\theta _3-c=0 $$ When taking the time derivative of this equation, keep in mind that \\( d=d(t) \\) is still a value that changes with respect to time. This will result in the terms \\( \\dot(d) \\ddot(d) \\), which represents the change and rate of change in length of the link with respect to time. Similarly, if you set up a three-position vector loop for an inverted crank-slider, you will see three unknowns (\\( \\theta_3 \\), \\( s(t) \\), and \\( \\beta (t) \\)). By breaking up the inverted crank-slider into four position vector loops, there are still three unknown variables (\\( \\theta_3 \\), \\( \\beta (t) \\), and \\( \\theta_4 \\)), but another equation appears due to geometry of the four-bar linkage. The angle \\( \\gamma \\) is constant because link four and the slider are fixed in an inverted crank-slider. This reveals the equation: Extra Equation for Inverted Crank-Slider $$ \\theta _3 = \\gamma + \\theta _4 $$ With three unknown variables and three equations, we can use a solver to obtain the values of all unknown variables.",

    "title": "Virtual work",
    "text": "Virtual Work  Virtual Work Intro In the previous section, we discussed how to analyze a mechanism using DFA. As you may have noticed, it is a complicated process. Moreover, often we are not interested in the intermediate forces in a linkage; we are only interested in how the input forces affect the output forces. Virtual work gives us a relatively easy way to analyze the input and output forces of a linkage, focusing solely on external forces. A quick refresher of concepts applying to work and energy can be found here. Let's first review the Dot Product. The dot product is a vector that takes two vectors and returns a scalar. The dot product between two 2D vectors, \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\), can be evaluated as: Dot Product $$ \\begin{gather} \\vec{a}=a_x\\hat{i}+a_y\\hat{j} \\\\ \\vec{b}=b_x\\hat{i}+b_y\\hat{j} \\\\ \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}=a_xb_x+a_yb_y=||\\vec{a}||\\,||\\vec{b}||\\cos{\\theta}\\end{gather} $$ Note that \\( \\theta \\) is the angle between the two vectors. Virtual work method Let's first start with the definition of work and power. Work for linear movement is defined as: Linear Work $$ W=\\vec{F}\\cdot\\vec{d} $$ and work for rotational movement is defined as: Rotational Work $$ W=\\vec{\\tau}\\cdot\\vec{\\theta} $$ Power is the time-derivative of work. Thus, the power for linear movement is: Linear Power $$ P=\\frac{d}{dt}W=\\vec{F}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{d}=\\vec{F}\\cdot\\vec{v} $$ and power for rotational movement is: Rotational Power $$ P=\\frac{d}{dt}W=\\vec{\\tau}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{\\theta}=\\vec{\\tau}\\cdot\\vec{\\omega} $$ If energy is conserved in a system, then we can write the following energy balance: Energy Balance $$ P_{in}=P_{out}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}E_{system} $$ A good way to think about this is a bucket with a hole at the bottom. We can fill the bucket with water, which is analogous to energy. The rate of water entering the bucket is equal to the rate of water leaving the bucket, plus the rate of change of the total amount of water in the bucket. Water bucket analogy for energy balance Moving back to mechanisms, we can compute the input power of a system by looking at the driving torque and angular velocity, which gives us the first term of the equation above. Then, if we know the rate of change in energy of the system, we can calculate the output power. First, two assumptions will be made to simplify analysis: The system's energy is composed only of kinetic and potential energy. i.e., there is no friction or other sources of energy loss. The system's kinetic energy is far greater than potential energy, so potential energy will be neglected. i.e., \\( E_{system}=K_{system} \\). Thus, the energy conservation equation becomes: Energy Conservation $$ P_{in}=P_{out}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} K_{system} $$ Expanding the kinetic energy term gives: Expanded Kinetic Energy $$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} K_{system}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\frac{1}{2} m_n v_n ^2= \\sum_{i=0}^{n}m_n v_n \\cdot a_n $$ Rewriting the equation gives: VW Equation $$ P_{out}=P_{in}-\\sum_{i=0}^n m_n v_n \\cdot a_n $$ With this in mind, if we know the input power and the velocity and acceleration of each component in the system, we can compute the output force or torque. In summary, the virtual work methods allow us to skip over the DFA process. Using only information about the input forces and the PVA data of a system, we can compute its output force and torque.",

    "title": "Balancing",
    "text": "Balancing  Balancing We normally treat the ground as an immovable object when considering the forces that mechanisms might apply to it. However, in practice this is not always the case. For many mechanisms, it is advantageous to try to minimize the forces and moments that are applied to the ground. Shaking force (\\( \\overrightarrow F_s \\)) is the total force acting on the ground plane. Similarly, shaking torque (\\( \\overrightarrow T_s \\)) is the reaction torque and shaking moment (\\( \\overrightarrow M_s \\)) is the total moment both of which are felt by the ground plane. These shaking forces and moments often occur in rotating machinery and mechanisms such as gas turbines, electric motors, and piston engines. This shaking can cause vibration, noise, failure, and more in a given system. Key Assumptions: We assume that there are no external or gravitational forces. Furthermore, the motor driving link 2 creates the torque felt on the link and the pin joint. As there is no motor controlling the ground joint supporting link 4, there is no added torque to the free body diagram. To balance a system, it is assumed that there are no unbalanced forces due to external forces or gravity, as it is difficult to balance these things. Instead, we work to balance the internal forces that come from accelerating a body's center of mass. Balancing is achieved by adding some small balancing masses to reduce or eliminate the net forces and moments. This does not eliminate these loads, but rather adds additional forces to counteract these so that the net load is zero. Balancing Applications When mechanisms are unbalanced, they often fail, sometimes catastrophically Washing Machine vs Brick Spinning Lego Wheels FAST ''Single Plane'' Balance Consider the pin joint in the figure below. The angular momentum is constant, so there is no torque acting on the pin joint. The forces on this pin joint come from accelerating the center of mass of a crank so that it moves in a circle. This cyclical loading can cause fatigue or change the behavior of the motor. This force is: Single Plane Balancing Force $$ \\overrightarrow F_{21}=m_2a=-m_2 \\omega_2^2 \\overrightarrow R_2 $$ To eliminate it, we have a few options: Reduce \\( m_2 \\) to \\( 0 \\). This is not realistic, as the linkage would no longer exist. Reduce \\( \\omega_2 \\) to \\( 0 \\). This means that our mechanism cannot move, which defeats its purpose. Reduce \\( \\overrightarrow R_2 \\) to \\( 0 \\). This is feasible. We just need to move the center of mass to align with the axis of rotation. To do this, we need to add an additional mass to move the center of mass. We will call this ``mass b'' to represent the balancing mass. Recall that the center of mass is: Center of Mass $$ \\sum_{i=0}^n m_ir_i $$ Since we want the center of mass to be located at the position of the axis, we can make the axis the origin. This means that the balancing mass \\( m_b \\) and the balancing distance \\( r_b \\) should fulfill Single Plane Balancing Equation $$ \\sum_{i=0}^n (m_ir_i)+m_br_b=0 $$ Essentially, we need the sum of the masses times their distance from the axis to be 0. This will result in no net inertial force on the pin joint. We also note that we have 2 unknowns, \\( m_b \\) and \\( r_b \\). However, this is actually a good thing, as it allows for designers to decide whether they prefer a large heavy mass close to the axis, or a smaller one that is further away. ''Two Plane'' Balance The previous procedure effectively eliminates the forces arising from the rotation of masses in a single plane. However, if all of the masses are not in a single plane, the forces from these masses can cause a moment on the shaft. This leads us to the idea of two plane (or dynamic) balance. In this case, we add two masses in different planes with the goal of eliminating the net inertial force, as well as the moment arising from these inertial forces. To compute the moment Moment From Inertial Force $$ M=r \\times F = l \\times F = l \\times (m \\omega^2\\overrightarrow R) $$ Where \\( l \\) is the position vector along the axis or shaft, whereas \\( \\overrightarrow R \\) is the vector pointing from the shaft to the mass. Our goal is to make it such that the sum of all of these moments is 0. To do this, set up two different correction planes to put masses in. Take the moment around one plane. A good example for dynamic balancing is a CT scanner. A CT scanner is composed of many different elements that have to rotate about an axis at a constant rate to get a good image of the person being scanned. For this example, let us simplify the CT scanner and only consider the x-ray source, the x-ray detectors, and the cooling system. Assume the x-ray source and the cooling system as a single point mass located at the center of mass of each system while the x-ray detectors as two point masses as there are more detectors that each have a sizable mass. In this case, the location of the x-ray source and detectors is known because they have to be across from each other to operate properly. Using the cooling system and an extra balance, we can work to balance the system. In this example, you are free to decide the mass of the balance and the cooling fluid along with the x- and y-positions of each. By summing taking the sum of the forces and setting them equal to zero, two equations will result (one with x-components and one with y-components). $$ \\sum_{i=0}^n m_i\\omega ^2\\overrightarrow R_i = 0 $$ $$ m_1\\overrightarrow R_1\\omega^2+m_2\\overrightarrow R_2\\omega^2+m_3\\overrightarrow R_3\\omega^2+m_A\\overrightarrow R_A\\omega^2+m_B\\overrightarrow R_B\\omega^2 = 0 $$ X-Component: $$ m_AR_{Ax} +m_B R_{Bx} = - m_1R_{1x}- m_2 R_{2x}- m_3 R_{3x} $$ Y-Component: $$ m_A R_{Ay} +m_BR_{By} = - m_1 R_{1y}- m_2 R_{2y}- m_3 R_{3y} $$ We can also find two more equations by summing the moments about plane A. $$ \\sum_{i=0}^n m_i\\omega \\overrightarrow R_i l_i = 0 $$ $$ (m_1\\overrightarrow R_1\\omega ^2)l_1 + (m_2\\overrightarrow R_2\\omega ^2)l_2 +(m_3\\overrightarrow R_3\\omega ^2)l_3 + (m_B\\overrightarrow R_B\\omega ^2)l_B = 0 $$ X-Component: $$ m_BR_{Bx}= \\frac{-m_1R_{1x}l_1-m_2R_{2x}l_2-m_3R_{3x}l_3}{l_B} $$ Y-Component: $$ m_BR_{By}= \\frac{-m_1R_{1y}l_1-m_2R_{2y}l_2-m_3R_{3y}l_3}{l_B} $$ We have six unknowns (two masses, two x-positions, two y-positions). Again, this is okay because it allows for design freedom.",

    "title": "Failure theories",
    "text": "Failure Theories  Introduction to Failure Theories Failure theories are essential in predicting whether a material will fail under a given load. These theories help engineers design safe structures by considering different stress conditions. This document covers the most commonly used failure theories along with their mathematical formulations. Maximum Normal Stress Theory Principle: failure occurs when the maximum normal stress exceeds the material's ultimate tensile or compressive strength. Failure Condition: \\( \\sigma_{1} > S_{ut} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\sigma_{3} < -S_{uc} \\) Where: \\( S_{ut} \\): Ultimate tensile strength \\( S_{uc} \\): Ultimate compressive strength \\( \\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{3} \\): Maximum and minimum principal stresses The image below is a plot of \"safe\" region according to maximum normal stress theory. By plotting the maximum and minimum principal stresses, the shaded region shows where the object will not fail. If a material is exposed to a stress that exceeds the tensile strength, that point would lie to the right, or above the shaded region. A stress that exceed the compressive strength would lie to the left or below the shaded region. Applications Suitable for brittle materials like ceramics and cast iron. Not applicable for ductile materials due to plastic deformation. Maximum Shear Stress Theory (Tresca Theory) Principle: Failure occurs when the maximum shear stress exceeds the shear yield strength \\( S_{sy} \\). Failure Condition: \\( \\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{|\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3|}{2} > S_{sy} \\) Since \\( S_{sy} \\) = \\( \\frac{S_{yt}}{2} \\), we can write: \\( |\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3| > S_{yt} \\) Where: \\( S_{yt} \\): Tensile yield strength \\( S_{ys} \\): Shear yield strength \\( \\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{3} \\): Maximum and minimum principal stresses The image below is a plot of \"safe\" region according to maximum shear stress theory. By plotting the maximum and minimum principal stresses, the shaded region shows where the object will not fail. Since shear stress is proportional to the difference in the maximum and minimum principal stresses, we modify the safe region from the maximum normal stress theory to limit the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses. Applications Best suited for ductile materials like steel and aluminum. Used in mechanical and structural engineering design. Maximum Distortion Energy Theory (Von Mises Theory) Principle: Yielding occurs when the distortion energy per unit volume reaches a critical value. Failure Condition: \\( \\sigma_{VM} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y)^2 + (\\sigma_y - \\sigma_z)^2 + (\\sigma_x - \\sigma_z)^2 + 6(\\tau_xy^2 + \\tau_yz^2 + \\tau_xz^2)}{2}} \\) or \\( \\sigma_{VM} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2}{2}} \\) Failure occurs if: \\( \\sigma_{VM} > S_{yt} \\) For a 2D stress state \\( \\sigma_3 = 0 \\) \\( \\sigma_{VM} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 - \\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + \\sigma_2^2}=\\sqrt{ \\sigma_x^2 - \\sigma_x\\sigma_y + \\sigma_y^2 + 3\\tau_{xy}^2} \\) The image below is a plot of \"safe\" region according to maximum distortion energy theory. By plotting the maximum and minimum principal stresses, the shaded region shows where the object will not fail. For a 2D object, this region will appear as a rotated ellipse. Applications Preferred for ductile materials. Used in finite element analysis (FEA) and plasticity theory. Fracture Mechanics and Crack Propagation Principle: Materials can fail when a crack propagates through them. Failure Condition: \\( K \\geq K_c \\) Failure due to brittle fracture occurs when the Stress Intensity Factor \\( K \\) exceeds a material's Fracture Toughness \\( K_c \\) We can compute the stress intensity factor according to \\( K = Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} \\) Where: \\( K \\): Stress intensity factor \\( Y \\): Geometric factor \\( \\sigma \\): Applied stress \\( a \\): Crack length Let us now walk through how to determine the value of each of these terms. \\( \\sigma \\) will depend on the specific loading condition that is applied to the material. \\( a \\) is a geometric parameter that should be directly measured. \\( K \\) can be directly computed from \\( \\sigma \\) and \\( a \\). This leaves \\( Y \\), the geometry factor. Identification of this value will usually be done with the use of lookup tables that contain the values of \\( Y \\) for a wide variety of geometries and loading conditions. It is also valuable to recall that \\( K_c \\) is a material property that will often be listed along with other material properties. Applications Used in failure predictions for materials with cracks. Important in aerospace, nuclear, and structural applications. Conclusion Each failure theory provides unique insights into material behavior. While von Mises theory is best for ductile materials, brittle materials require normal stress theory or fracture mechanics. Altogether, it is the responsibility of an engineer to identify the most appropriate theory and apply it to determine if a component will work as intended.",

    "title": "Stress concentrations",
    "text": "Stress Concentrations  Introduction to Stress Concentrations In mechanical engineering, \"stress concentration\" refers to the increase in stress around small features like holes, notches, or sharp corners in a material. Imagine you're trying to tear a piece of paper. If you pull it from both ends, it's tough to rip. But if you make a small cut (a notch) first, the tear spreads easily from there. This happens because stress (force per unit area) gets concentrated around sharp edges or holes. Actual Stress Distribution vs Nominal Stress Imagine a metal plate like the one shown in Figure 1, with a hole in the middle, being pulled from both ends. The stress (force per area) is not evenly spread across the plate. Instead, it is concentrated near the edges of the hole. This introduces a relationship between the Nominal Stress and Maximum Stress (\\( \\sigma_{nom} \\) and \\( \\sigma_{max} \\) respectively) related by the Stress Concentration Factor (\\( K_t \\)). Their relationship can be defined as follows: Nominal Stress: The average stress. Maximum Stress: The highest stress, which occurs at the edge of the stress concentration. Concentration Factor: A number that tells us how much the stress is increased due to the stress concentration. For example, if \\( K_t=3 \\) , then the highest stress (Located at the edge of the hole, crack, or notch) is three times the applied stress. Example Problem Consider the steel plate below, with a width of \\( 100 \\; mm \\) and a thickness of \\( 10 \\; mm \\) is subjected to a tensile force of \\( 20 \\; Kn \\). The plate has a circular hole with a diameter of \\( 20 \\; mm \\) at its center. The stress concentration factor for this geometry is given as \\( K_t = 3 \\). What is the Nominal stress \\( \\sigma_{nom} \\)? What is the Maximum Stress \\( \\sigma_{max} \\)? Figure 1: Sample stress concentration problem Step 1: Compute the Nominal Stress \\( A= (W-d) \\times t= (100 - 20) \\times 10 = 800 \\text{ mm}^2 \\) Thus, the nominal stress is: \\( \\sigma_{\\text{nom}} = \\frac{20,000 \\text{ N}}{800 \\text{ mm}^2} = 25 \\text{ MPa} \\) + Warning: Computing Cross Sectional Area #stress_concentration_warning The diameter of the hole must be subtracted from the height of the plate to calculate the correct cross sectional area. Step 2: Compute the Maximum Stress The maximum stress \\( \\sigma_{\\text{max}} \\) at the edge of the hole is given by: \\( \\sigma_{\\text{max}} = K_t \\times \\sigma_{\\text{nom}} \\) \\( \\sigma_{\\text{max}} = 3 \\times 25 \\text{ MPa} = 75 \\text{ MPa} \\) Application of Stress Concentrations What happens if the stress exceeds the yield strength of the material? Plastic Deformation As we increase the stress on an object, we know that the the stress can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep increasing past a certain limit, called the yield strength \\( S_y \\) of the material. If stress exceeds the yield strength of the material, plastic deformation will occur. If the stress is evenly distributed across the entire object, this plastic deformation will often cause the object to fail. However, if a stress concentration is present, it is possible for the maximum stress to exceed the yield strength of the material, while the nominal stress remains below the material's yield strength. Once yeilding occurs: Some areas reach their maximum stress limit and start deforming permanently. This means that these areas cannot bear any additional stress. As a result, the stress that was supposed to be born by these area is instead redistributed to other areas in a process called load redistribution. This makes the stress spread out. Figure 2: Diagram of Stress Redistribution In figure 2 we can see this process in a little more detail: The orange curve shows the stress that is applied to the object assuming the material stays elastic (no permanent deformation). The vertical dashed lines, \\( \\sigma_{nom} \\),\\( S_y \\),and \\( \\sigma_{max} \\) represent the nominal stress, the yield strength and the maximum stress respectively he blue curve shows the redistributed stress that the material experiences after plastically deforming and redistributing the stress. Note that the nominal stress is the same, as the decrease in stress near the stress concentration is offset by an increase in the stress further away from the stress concentration. Residual Stresses After Unloading After the external force is removed, the object will try to return to its original shape. Elastic deformation will be recovered but the plastically deformed regions cannot return to their original form. Due to this, some stresses remain inside the material. These are called residual stresses, and it can be calculated by subtracting the elastic stress (shown in orange) from the actual stress (shown in blue). Design Considerations As an engineer, it is important to know when we should consider the effects of stress concentrations, as well as times that the effects of stress concentrations can be safely ignored. In general, stress concentrations can be safely ignored when the material in question is ductile. This is because the material can yield locally, and redistribute stresses. Even if local plastic deformation does occur, it is unlikely to cause the object as a whole to fail. However, there are several situations were it is imperative to consider the impact of stress concentrations. Brittle materials may fracture rather than yield locally, so a stress concentration can cause catastrophic failure. Impact or dynamic loading may cause stresses to be applied so quickly that they cannot be adequately redistributed, causing failure. Repeated loading can cause fatigue failure due to cyclic loading. In these scenarios the presence of stress concentrations can accelerate the process of fatigue failure and should be considered.",

    "text": "Threaded Components  Introduction to Threaded Components Threaded components are any mechanical device that has spiral ridges (threads) that form a helical shape around a central cylinder. One of the most common examples of a threaded components is a screw, which uses the angled threads to create a large force along the length of the screw when a modest input torque is used to tighten the screw. However, screws are not the only mechanical components that use threads. Threads are also present in the feet used to level household appliances, in nuts, as well as bolts. In this page, we will highlight a few tools that can be used to analyze the behavior of any threaded component. While screws and bolts are often used to create a mechanical advantage, threaded components can also be used in a wide variety of other applications. Some of these other applications include: Converting Motion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 turning rotation into straight-line movement Distributing Force \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sharing a load across multiple threads Acting as a Spring \u00e2\u0080\u0093 handling force and stretching slightly under pressure Power Screws Power Screws turn rotation into straight-line motion. This happens because threads form an inclined plane around the cylinder. An input torque can cause the screw to revolve around its axis. As the screw revolves, the threads can move an object along the length of the screw. Lead Angle One of the most important parameters governing the behavior of a power screw is its \"Lead Angle\" \\( \\lambda \\). This angle represents the angle between the thread and a cross sectional cut of the threaded component. The lead angle can be found with the following equation: Lead Angle Derivation #LA $$ \\tan \\lambda = \\frac{L}{\\pi d_m} $$ Pitch (p): The distance between two threads Lead (L): The vertical distance a screw travels in 1 full rotation (an integer multiple of the pitch if there is more than 1 thread) Mean diameter (\\( d_m \\)): The average of the diameters of the threads and the diameter of the shaft of the screw Thread Angle Another key angle to consider when working with threaded components is the \"Thread Angle\" \\( \\alpha_n \\). This represents the angle between two adjacent threads. However, when analyzing the forces on a threaded component, it is often most useful to find the Lead Angle Derivation #LA $$ \\tan \\lambda = \\frac{L}{\\pi d_m} $$ Begin by listing known information. In this case, we know the link lengths of a mechanism, as well as the angular velocity of the crank. Next, compute all of the instant centers on the mechanism. We then can consider the crank of the mechanism. We know that the pin between the crank and ground is an instant center. Since the ground link has a velocity of 0 everywhere, the crank will have a velocity of 0 at that location. Let's call the crank body 2, and the ground link body 1. Then, select another grounded linkage. This is the link that we will analyze. Let's call that body 3. Body 1 and body 3 will share an instant center, which we will call \\( A \\). Using \\( v_a=v_{IC_{1,2}}+r_{IC_{1,2} \\rightarrow a} \\times \\omega_2 \\) we can substitute in for \\( v_{IC_{1,2}}, r_{IC_{1,2} \\rightarrow a} \\) and \\( \\omega_2 \\) to find \\( v_a \\). We can reuse the above equation, but instead consider that point \\( A \\) is also attached to body 3. Thus, we could consider the velocity of point \\( A \\) as coming from the rotation of body 3 rather than the rotation of body 2. We would write this equation as \\( v_a=v_c+r_{c \\rightarrow a} \\times \\omega_3 \\). The biggest issue here is that we do not know where to place point \\( C \\) so that we know its velocity. If we place it at point \\( A \\), the radius will be 0, and we will be unable to compute \\( \\omega_3 \\). However, there is another location where we know the velocity of a point on body 3. If we consider \\( IC_{1,3} \\) we know that the ground has a velocity of 0 everywhere. Thus, at \\( IC_{1,3} \\), the ground and body 3 have the same speed, 0. This allows us to write \\( v_a=0+r_{IC_{1,3} \\rightarrow a} \\times \\omega_3 \\). Since we know all of these values except \\( \\omega_3 \\), we can then solve for \\( \\omega_3 \\). Now that \\( \\omega_3 \\) is known, we can compute \\( V_b \\), and \\( \\omega_4 \\). Additionally, this procedure can be repeated to find the velocities of all links in a mechanism. Efficiency of Power Screws A key performance metric for power screws is their efficiency, which is the output work divided by the input work. Power Screw Efficiency #PSE $$ e = \\frac{W L}{2\\pi T} $$ Where W: Is the weight being lifted L: Is the lead of the screw, which is how far the weight is lifted in one revolution of the screw T: Is the torque applied to the screw Power Screw Forces When a power a screw lifts a weight, different forces act on the weight itself Normal force (N): is the force from the inclined surface of the thread. Friction force \\( f \\cdot n \\) : is the force resisting motion. Input force (Q): Is the force applied to lift the weight, usually from an input torque. Balancing these forces gives the following equation: Power Screw Forces #PSF $$ Q = W \\frac{\\cos \\lambda + f \\cos \\alpha_n}{\\cos \\alpha_n - f \\sin \\lambda} $$ Power Screw Self Locking and Overhauling When the external force or torque is removed from a power screw, the weight may fall down if the force from gravity exceeds the friction force. However, if friction is sufficiently high, no motion will occur, even in the absence of an external force. Self-locking: A mass lifted by a power screw stays in place when no force is applied. Overhauling: A mass lifted by a power screw moves on its own when the force is removed. Whether a power screw is self locking or overhauling is dependent of the geometry of the screw as well as the friction coefficient. For a screw to be self locking the friciton coefficient must satisfy the equation shown below. Power Screw Self Locking #PSLock $$ f\\geq \\frac{L \\cos(\\alpha_n)}{\\pi d_m} $$ Bolts and Bolted Connections Bolted connections clamp things together using a bolt and nut. The bolt is stretched (tension), while the material being clamped is squeezed (compression). Pre-load force \\( F_i \\): The force applied when tightening a bolt. External force \\( F_e \\): The extra force trying to separate the joint. This gives us two equations for the force on the bolt \\( F_b \\) and the clamping force \\( F_c \\) Bolt Force #FB $$ F_b = F_i + \\frac{k_b}{k_b + k_c} F_e $$ Clamping Force #FC $$ F_c = F_i - \\frac{k_c}{k_b + k_c} F_e $$ Where \\( k_b \\): stiffness of bolt \\( k_c \\): stiffness of clamped material Thread Stripping One of the most common methods for threaded components to fail is due the the threads shearing off. In order to strip a thread, the applied force must cause the stress to exceed the Von Mises yield strength of the material, \\( S_{sy}=0.58 S_y \\) . For a component with standard threads of width \\( .75 p \\) the area that must be sheared, \\( A_s \\) is: Nut Shear Area #SA $$ A_s = 0.75 \\pi d t $$ Where \\( d \\): outer diameter of the bolt \\( t \\): height of the nut This means that the force required to shear the threads is: Nut Shear Force #SF $$ F = A_s S_{sy} $$ Additional Considerations Bolt sizes and grades are highly standardized, meaning that it is often far cheaper to use an existing threaded component rather than creating a customized one It is often advantageous for a nut to fail in a bolted connection before the bolt, as the bolt can still restrict some directions of motion, even if the nut has failed Screws convert rotation into straight-line motion. Power screws provide mechanical advantage to lift heavy loads. Bolted connections use pre-load force to hold parts together. Threads can fail by shearing if overloaded.",
